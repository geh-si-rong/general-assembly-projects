Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

Here we explore the 2017 and 2018 SAT & ACT data sets for each US State, studying the participation rates, score breakdown by individual subjects, total scores for SATs and composite scores for the ACT. Our goal is to increase participation rates for either of these 2 tests, and to study the correlation between participation rates and test scores for each state.
