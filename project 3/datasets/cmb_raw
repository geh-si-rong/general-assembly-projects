,coffeemeetsbagel,"Hi everyone,
This is a rather long thread. I may look like I'm spilling everything, but I just wanna say, even decent people are not that great sometimes.....

So a few months ago, I was talking with this guy from CmB. When we met up, he was decent, but I found the things he talked online with me kinda insensitive.

He would tell me to inform him whenever I'm working out. He'd ask me if I have abs lines on my stomach (what a fucked up thing to ask, tbh) because he assumed everyone who works out would have a line on their belly.

He said ""drama"" when I genuinely was telling him stories about my past. He claimed I liked to overreact, a drama queen, when at the same time, he also confided in me about personal things (his fight with mom). 
He claimed his ex-GF couldn't do anything, was bad at English, had no friends, awkward among new people, unreliable, and dressed unfashionably (like a migrant worker, he said). I honestly think his fashion wasn't the best either. He claimed he did NOT love his ex that he dated for 5 years; didn't know why he dated her when they got nothing in common, he said. He asked me whether I think my ex was good-looking. I said yes, but he just said ""I think my ex was just okay. Other men prioritize physical appearance, but I don't"". He seemed proud when I mentioned about him treating his ex like a charity case.

He kept sending me pictures of his veiny hand, which I think he's proud of it too. He sent me pic of his hand when he's driving, petting his dog. I feel like men would send pictures that they are proud of. He also sometimes sent his work, which I appreciate.

He made me feel bad about not going out with friends, when there's a pandemic looming around. I don't feel bad about not being too social tho, but I don't know why he made a big deal out of ""hanging out with friends"", when in reality, he felt like he could not truly confide with his own friends because he doesn't trust them. And he felt like he got overlooked by his own best friends when they forgot his own bday. He told me, ""It's nice having you around to talk about nonsensical things"" - to be honest, this kinda hurt me because we talked about a lot of personal stuff, not only about nonsense.

He kept calling me a stranger, a person. He refused to call me by my name although we have met a couple of times because it's ""too intimate"", he said. In reality, he called his own friends by names. This guy was very cocky, saying things like ""Oh, did you lose sleep because you've been thinking about what i said?"" and ""Your ex was bad at sex, wasn't he"". And he would be very pretentious, saying things like - ""According to data, I will rank boba tea from worst to best"" 
and 
""I like the current arrangement of our chats right now, with me not replying too often"" 
and 
""You have passed the chatting criteria, according to me. Most only lasted for 2 months"". I was just very naive at that time, thinking he was cool lol. 

Uhm, Yeah I think that's about it? He sends me cool comic strips though, those were nice. I just think he's kind of a prick, don't you also think so?

I did everything they told me to do to make my profile &amp;quot;pop&amp;quot; and it doesnt help at all. Is height really that big of a deal??&lt;/p&gt;

,coffeemeetsbagel,"First time trying online dating. 10 days and counting. 9 matches. No dates yet.

If there's anything I've gotten out of this app, it's that talking doesn't have to be hard. I'm terrible at conversation, even with close friends, and I'm even worse at being the one to start talking. But being on CMB has forced me to start the convos and turns out it's not that bad.

Biggest trip-up from the app: when it's showing you a bagel that already liked you, only a chat button shows up instead of both like and chat. This freaked me out at first bc I thought if someone already liked my profile, my only option is to start a chat, which I was scared of. passed on one or two decent bagels in my first few days bc of this. It took me a while to realise hitting the chat button once just 'likes' the profile but I don't have to message them right away. I've now gotten over this and sent the first message in most of my matches.

Things that make me pass a profile:

1. lack of info. Either no prompts answered or sparse one-liner responses or non answers. This is the most common one. e.g. one guy wrote ""what a generic question"" for 'I like...' Sure it's generic but just answering it straight would give me more info than this useless response. Filling up your profile gives me things I can start a chat with!!
2. when every photo is a gym photo/mirror selfie/mask photo/group shot/distance shot where I can't really see your face. Also if you're gonna take a mirror selfie at least make sure your face is in focus and not obscured by your phone. (ETA: forgot to mention: when every photo is a national service photo)
3. Profile says 'want kids' --&gt; hard pass. This one's just personal. Similarly, if any of their photos show them with kids, even if their details doesn't answer the family plans prompt. Or, in one case, saying his fear is ""telling his future kids How I Met Your Mother on CMB""
4. selfies with snapchat filters/other filters. especially the dog ones or animal ears. Maybe some people find that cute but I hate those.
5. photos with women (unless it's clear it's a family member, or it's a group/activity shot with multiple people)
6. Mentioning their religion in their prompts. Having a religion is fine, but writing about it suggests a devotion that I cannot match.

I'm a female looking at male profiles, so I'm curious if there's any ""trends"" across female profiles that guys (or other women) notice?

other random things:

* does anyone read the captions on photos? it's not that I don't care, but I tend to forget I can do that cos you gotta tap on the photos to open the captions.
* this one guy who's almost a foot taller than me, who states that he likes his date to be tall, yet still liked my profile. Was confused, but I'll take it as a compliment i.e. I have other qualities that lets you overlook my height. Or maybe he didn't even read my profile to see my height, so...guess my pictures are good-looking enough?
* just stating your horoscope/MBTI type does not a profile make. I mean, I do find MBTI theory kinda interesting but I can't judge your entire person based on your type.
* this app sure is glitchy. the 'likes you' section seems to update later than the other tabs. And some days the app only showed me like 6 bagels at noon but added more later in the day as if the system was slow or something.
* sending a message that just says ""hi"" or ""hello"" when liking someone is useless.

&lt;li&gt;just stating your horoscope/MBTI type does not a profile make. I mean, I do find MBTI theory kinda interesting but I can&amp;#39;t judge your entire person based on your type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this app sure is glitchy. the &amp;#39;likes you&amp;#39; section seems to update later than the other tabs. And some days the app only showed me like 6 bagels at noon but added more later in the day as if the system was slow or something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sending a message that just says &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; when liking someone is useless. I feel like this is something the app suggests to people (&amp;quot;sending a message increases chances of a match&amp;quot; owtte) but it&amp;#39;s gotta have a bit more substance&lt;/li&gt;

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Hey everyone, 19M here. Ever since COVID ruined my senior year of HS and first semester of college, I’ve had a torrid time trying to date. I’ll be honest, one of my close HS friends started to date this girl from my college that I had talked to briefly in August 2020. Legit everytime I hang out with him, he’s always talking to her and they always are talking 24/7. It’s not the fact that he’s dating a girl that I had talked to before, it’s the fact that they have this close connection and love for each other that just reminds me of my own struggles and always depresses me. Some people might call it jealousy but the only thing I’m jealous about is how lucky my friend is to have found such an amazing girl and have such a close bond and relationship with her. All of my friends I talk to always tell me to stop overthinking it and to wait until we get to campus so I can meet girls in person. For my personality, I thrive when I’m spending time with my friends and hanging out. So when I can’t do any of that stuff and I have to stay home with no one to talk to, it just always depresses me and just makes me more desperate (I hate to admit that). I’ve come to realization that at this point, I’m just looking to date to date (if you know what I mean). I just want someone that I can talk to about deep stuff, have a close relationship with, late night FT calls, do cute stuff, etc. Call me an attention-seeker but it’s just depressing when you’re spending most of the time alone at home.

Legit everytime I hang out with him, he’s always talking to her and they always are talking 24/7. It’s not the fact that he’s dating a girl that I had talked to before, it’s the fact that they have this close connection and love for each other that just reminds me of my own struggles and always depresses me. Some people might call it jealousy but the only thing I’m jealous about is how lucky my friend is to have found such an amazing girl and have such a close bond and relationship with her. All of my friends I talk to always tell me to stop overthinking it and to wait until we get to campus so I can meet girls in person. For my personality, I thrive when I’m spending time with my friends and hanging out. So when I can’t do any of that stuff and I have to stay home with no one to talk to, it just always depresses me and just makes me more desperate (I hate to admit that). I’ve come to realization that at this point, I’m just looking to date to date (if you know what I mean). I just want someone that I can talk to about deep stuff, have a close relationship with, late night FT calls, do cute stuff, etc. Call me an attention-seeker but it’s just depressing when you’re spending most of the time alone at home. I just needed to let that out and for all those people that’s going through the difficulties that I’m going through, you’re not alone I promise you that. If you read through all of this, thank you for listening to my TED Talk.&lt;/p&gt;

Confused by a couple things: 

1) i know the suggestions page only offers a batch of profiles a day, but does anyone know how often the “likes you” page refreshes? That one seems to be endless random refreshes multiple times a day, id clear all 8 profiles multiple times a day and it always randomly refreshes w another 8? 

2) how does the priority likes feature work? Most of the ppl in my matches either ones ive accepted thru “suggestion” or “likes you” tab seem to have this purple heart beside their pic and a banner in the chat that says we matched sooner thanks to “priority likes”, so i googled priority likes and read that its bc theyre either a premium user or paid beans to use this feature to “super like” my profile to skip the line so that i will see their profile earlier

there was this one profile that i “liked” thru suggestions, so i’m pretty sure its the only profile so far that i had been the first to like instead of them having already liked me, then the next day i see them appear in my chat saying that we matched which i was like cool they like me back BUT it also says that we matched thru “priority likes” and his pic also has a purple heart so now i’m like huh super confused??

,coffeemeetsbagel,"I thought this might be worth a mention, because I'm a guy who is looking to find dates and, if lucky, be in a relationship, and I suspect that most guys and girls would use this app for same reasons.

Another reason why I'm creating this post is because I stumbled upon only a few profiles where they explicitly say that they're only here to look for friends.

Now, it's easy enough for me to make my decision to either pass or give 'like' and see where it goes. But then there are profiles that don't say this at all, and you happened to match with some of them and really hit it off in the chats until, 2 days later, they confess to you that their only intention is to ""find friends"".

I must admit that it did immediately tick me off slightly because of the time and energy I've invested with these guys, but I also initially thought this was purely a dating app. To my surprise when I googled 'CmB', I  found out that this is also a ""social networking service"", which I guess could may as well mean that people use this app to find friends also..

I checked my profile setings to see if there is an option to display my intentions of using this app (i.e. ""Looking for: **Relationship**""), but there isn't, unless I'm missing something here?

&lt;p&gt;3) Is she really decide to match with me, and both time decided not to talk? If so what&amp;#39;s the reason..i thought CMB is unlike Tinder etc where instead of blindly liking everyone, the profile is limited so people decide to like or not.&lt;/p&gt;

,coffeemeetsbagel,"**TL;DR:** Why girls message me first, then never reply? Is there something I can put in my bio to avoid matching with people who are on the app for other reasons not relating to the purpose of the app?

This happened on this app like 10 times now, every once in a while, I just give up hope and stop using the app, then I get a match with a girl I liked a couple of days ago, I am too depressed to try, then after few days the girl messages me, and it usually goes like this:

Girl: ""hey, how's your Saturday going?""

I reply within 15 minutes to 2 hours, depending if I was busy or not:

Me: ""Hey! Just made some some Mediterranean breakfast and now listening to music, how's yours going?""

And there where it ends. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why people do this? It could be just someone seeking attention and testing if I would reply or not, also it could be that the girl sent the same message to 10 other guys out of boredom. But if that's true, it's depressing because their profiles show that they are professionals/highly educated in their late 20s or early 30s. Other people would just chat for weeks and send me walls of text each day with lots of excitement, ""wow!"" and ""that's super interesting!!"", then they will ghost me the moment I suggest we video chat, other times when I suggest to video chat earlier after a day or two of chatting, I get the ""I still don't know you enough"" reply. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I am an educated, guy who eats healthy, works out, well traveled, reads books, thoughtful and a good person who cares about how people feel, even internet strangers, and at this point, I am just scratching my head looking at what happened to me on this app from a statistical perspective.

Like even when I don&amp;#39;t message, people reach out just so that they can ghost, it feels like people are addicted to ghosting or something.&lt;/p&gt;

So far, I'm averaging about 2 likes and 1 match a day. I even met up with one of them last weekend (I got the vibe that she liked me but I decided not to pursue because she lives kinda far from me). However, the majority of the women I match with only reply to my first message

Anyway, I am looking for a profile review: I have a few pics on standby that I haven't introduced to my profile but am curious to see what people think about how to improve mine. Thanks!

,coffeemeetsbagel,"1. I \*never\* like a dude back if he has a sweet picture with another girl around his age, unless he clarifies it's his sister or something (but still... why).
2. Similarly, having a picture of you and some kid (who looks like they might be your kid) is not quirky. I just don't read the captions sometimes. Ofc if you want a date who's okay with you being a father, disregard this point entirely.
3. This might be too specific but here goes. As an Asian woman, I'm extremely wary of any non-Asian man who has a picture of them visiting a Shintoism shrine/wearing an anime T-Shirt/etc. Extra wariness if that's their \*first\* picture. If liking Asia is part of your identity and you liked me, I have reasons to suspect you have yellow fever. Sorry.
4. Similarly, if you ""want someone to teach you Chinese""... sorry but I'd nope the f out. You may genuinely want to learn Chinese, but you don't have to bring it up on your dating app profile.
5. Know that there are platforms that are more appropriate for sugar dating. If being fancy is part of who you are that's alright, but there's a fine line between being open and showing off. How I see it, picture of you car-racing = cool, I have questions. Picture of your racecar with huge logo in frame = Eww. Does that make sense?
6. Having a group pic as your first picture is confusing. Not saying it's a deal-breaker or anything, just confusing.
7. Yes, I do like guys first from time to time. Usually, it's when they are physically attractive/have interesting jobs or experiences that made me curious/happen to also have one of my weird niche interests: essentially, someone I don't want to never see on CMB (or anywhere) again due to algorithms.
8. And yes, I do message guys first... when your profile gives me something to work with. If we matched, but I don't have anything to say AND you don't message me, I'd have to assume that you are one of many, many guys who mass-like every girl they see. In those cases, I'd just let the conversation expire. And no, saying ""ask me"" does \*not\* give me something to work with.
9. Flowers kinda have an effect... kiiiiiiiinda. I get &lt;=3 likes with flowers on an average day, so they do catch my attention. But a red flag is still a red flag. Also, the number of flowers doesn't matter.
10. If you ""want someone who has a sense of humor,"" maybe be a bit more specific about it. This is because a) I see this standard from guys way too often and b) it kinda sorta makes you come across as one of those people who mask offenses as ""jokes"" and blame everyone else for being too sensitive. Which is a huge no for me.

Why I'm writing this post:

1. I'm bored right now.
2. Idk, just to offer some insights from the ""other side."" If point 1 through 5 does not apply to you, kudos! I actually see almost \*all\* of them within the \~15 profiles I read every day.

Picture of your racecar with huge logo in frame = Eww. Does that make sense?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a group pic as your first picture is confusing. Not saying it&amp;#39;s a deal-breaker or anything, just confusing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, I do like guys first from time to time. Usually, it&amp;#39;s when they are physically attractive/have interesting jobs or experiences that made me curious/happen to also have one of my weird niche interests: essentially, someone I don&amp;#39;t want to never see on CMB (or anywhere) again due to algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And yes, I do message guys first... when your profile gives me something to work with. If we matched, but I don&amp;#39;t have anything to say AND you don&amp;#39;t message me, I&amp;#39;d have to assume that you are one of many, many guys who mass-like every girl they see. In those cases, I&amp;#39;d just let the conversation expire. And no, saying &amp;quot;ask me&amp;quot; does *not* give me something to work with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flowers kinda have an effect... kiiiiiiiinda. I get &amp;lt;=3 likes with flowers on an average day, so they do catch my attention. But a red flag is still a red flag. Also, the number of flowers doesn&amp;#39;t matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you &amp;quot;want someone who has a sense of humor,&amp;quot; maybe be a bit more specific about it. This is because a) I see this standard from guys way too often and b) it kinda sorta makes you come across as one of those people who mask offenses as &amp;quot;jokes&amp;quot; and blame everyone else for being too sensitive. Which is a huge no for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I&amp;#39;m writing this post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m bored right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idk, just to offer some insights from the &amp;quot;other side.&amp;quot; If point 1 through 5 does not apply to you, kudos! I actually see almost *all* of them within the ~15 profiles I read every day. Like, today I saw a dude who has a picture of him and his little nephew, with a caption along the lines of &amp;quot;here&amp;#39;s my obligatory picture with a kid that&amp;#39;s not mine according to online dating 101.&amp;quot; Like... what?&lt;/li&gt;

For some background I’m a 30M HK living in HK, so women I see on the app are a mix of ESL/ EFL or zero English. Sometimes you can gauge by the profile but since this is predominately an English app, most people try to front so if you go ‘full English’ you might scare people off.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Full Disclosure: I posted this same message on r/match as well, as I'm subscribed to both platforms. 

I've been on this platform for about a year now w/lackluster results.  When I've initiated conversations, I've either tried to ask simple introductory questions (ex. Hello, how is your day going?) to being bold and upfront in some (ex. Like your profile, and would like to get to know you more.  Are you up for an in-person or virtual chat to start?), and in some cases, just being direct (Damn you are fine, where are we going on our first date?).

Few questions. 

1) On my discovery tab there is a list of women that sent me a like. Below that are women shown to me to like or not. I found one that I was really attracted to and sent her a like.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Hi CMB

I’ve been using CMB on and off for a number of years now, and I’m glad to say I’m happily dating someone I met off the app for a few months now. As a romantic, I know it can feel a little unnatural using an app, but if you can make a bona fide effort, I think you’ll at least get an opportunity to meet some really great people.

I want to give back by writing a quick PSA: please please try your best to keep your personal hygiene as good as possible on your first couple dates. For girls, this includes shaving, in my opinion (and I believe it’s the opinion of most guys as well, even if they don’t verbalize it).

Earlier while using the app, I met a really wonderful girl. She was a young, pretty, accomplished doctor who for some reason was virtually in love with me by our third date (no comment on that). What’s more, she had a kind, gentle personality, as she really cared about her patients. However, on our second date (she was wearing a dress), when she passed the butter, I saw a full bush of hair coming from her armpits. At that moment I instantaneously lost any attraction for her, and i just couldn’t see her the same way anymore; I had to break it off.

Now obviously some of you will think I’m a mega chauvinist, and that “if not shaving was a deal breaker, she is better off not dating me”, that girls have a right to dress/look however they want... that’s all probably true. But I just couldn’t help feeling that way after I saw it. In mind of this, I think if you want to improve your odds of meeting someone special, please try to be as presentable as possible.

1. Matched with a girl on CMB
2. Girl asked to chat on IG bc she doesn't check CMB too much
3. Chatting on IG a bit
4. Girl asks if we can videochat. I think to myself sure why not Im bored. Virtual date is a thing now so okay. Should have realized it was a scam when she said ""can't talk bc grandparents are sleeping in the next room but can still chat with video on""
5. Turned on Google hangout. This ""girl"" suddenly appears on screen and starts stripping half naked. (Im extremely confused at this point and catching on to what is happening at this point)
6. Me: Okay...? wtf? No Im not going to take my pants off and join you. the f outta here.
7. Once realizing I wasn't stupid enough to fall for this, this scammer edits a video of my face at the start of the chat with some random dude's bottom half with his dick hanging out, and threatens me that he will send this edited video to all my friends on IG. Whats funny is that Im wearing a white tshirt when I turned on the video chat but the edited video of the masturbating dude is wearing a navy blue tshirt lol
8. Me: sure dude, thats not even me I dont care. I was just trying to chat with someone I matched on CMB but got this instead lmao. Whatever peace out.
9. I promptly took screenshots of our conversation and blocked this person.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay question. At that moment, I didn't give a shit bc its a fake ass edited video and told the scammer to piss off. Now I'm thinking if Im actually kinda screwed bc regardless of if the video is clearly edited or not, if this person sends this nasty video to all my friends, I will look stupid as hell?

There are re-occurring and current issues, mostly centered on chat:

\- 'Error logging in, please try again' message no matter how many times you verify correctly and reinstall; if you somehow log out, you're likely not to get back in for some time while your profile is active 

\- Disappearing textbox, chat messages that don't appear and don't display properly (ie., wrong order &amp; timestamp).

Anyways, here's my question. You know how, when you're looking through your ""bagels"", you have a choice of either passing, liking, or sending a message? If you choose the message option, how exactly does the person receive your message? What I mean is, does the app give them a notification saying ""you've received a message from xyz"", and then allow them to go right to that message and read it and look at your profile if they want (the way OkCupid used to work, which imo was much better), or does the person not even know you messaged them until they get you as one of their ""bagels"" and land on your profile (way OkCupid works now, which imo completely defeats the point of messaging someone first instead of just liking them)?

,coffeemeetsbagel,"So I'm a guy from Singapore and I've been using Coffee Meet Bagel for quite some time. I don't get matches, like few matches after like 3 months, haven't gone on a date before. So few days ago I decided to sign up for the premium (free trial) out of frustration and/or desperation. Here are some observations/findings.


- Active within 72 Hrs: Most of the Bagels they show are active within 72 Hr. Seldom you find bagels who are not active within 72 Hr.

- Sends first messages: Most girls do not send first messages. 0%. Sometimes (20%) you find some of the girls do send the first message (~20%). Not correlated with attractiveness.

- Chats with Bagels: Varies. Typically from 20% - 80%. I think this is a useful metric. If I see that the chats with bagels % is less than 20% I won't swipe. Waste of time.

- Usually replies within: varies, typically around 5-10 hours. Not sure how to make of this metric.

General conclusion: Is it useful? Not really. You get to see which girls don't reply, helping you to discard those profiles, but I don't think it is worth it for the price (S$47.98). But of course there's a lot more to premium, particularly being able to see who likes you. Unfortunately for me, I didn't have any, even after few weeks of swiping :(

###I appreciate when my date...
shares with me the hills and valleys of her life that made her the strong and virtuous young lady whom I’m fortunate enough to meet.

###Before we go onto a date, you should know...
courtship is no speculation. Let’s take the time to discover who we are and what we want. A good courtship ends with both of us making wise decisions. May we bring the right person into lifelong commitment.

###What makes a relationship successful?
A lifelong relationship builds upon loving the other more than oneself. Treat oneself with tenderness, but with the eagerness to sacrifice for the good of the beloved. There is no greater romance than such.

###Who should pay on the first date?
Me. It’s a small price to pay in searching for something truly priceless.

My TA are girls living in the same eastern Asian country as me. (I am open to all ethnicities though)

Got 8 matches so far.
I am a bit surprised cuz I am quite tall (180cm) and fit (80kg with 16~18% body fat) for the country i am living in and my look is around the average.

And no, I am not here for ego, but getting more matches means higher possibility of finding the right one, since there are tons of girls who are gonna ghost you or flake out for no reason.

English description is OK for them cuz most of the girls I met here on CMB are well educated, and I've seen quite a lot of profiles written in English.

My mother tongue isn't English, but you'll see I ditch out the flag of my country that I would normally put in the ""polyglot"" part, cuz I want to stay low key on the internet.

&lt;p&gt;A powerlifter, a rugby player, a value investor, a polyglot 🇬🇧🇩🇪🇫🇷🇪🇦, an explorer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like......&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weight training, playing rugby, watching funny videos, investing, learning languages, reading, traveling, divination, making impact, having deep convos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate when my date... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is sharp, courteous, willing to open up to talk when there is confusion and uncertainty,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;knows what she is doing or wants to do, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;has a hobby or specialty which she can talk about for hours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【End】&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions or advices will be highly appreciated.
Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

,coffeemeetsbagel,"33M. I started using CMB a week ago and am new to online dating. Got two matches and was wondering what I can change or improve on to get more matches. I am looking for a long term relationship that can potentially lead to a marriage. Targeting Asian females ages 23 to 35 who want kids and do not have children yet.

I am...

I am a daydreamer who lives life deeply and have big dreams that give me the courage to be myself. I grow and bond with family. I enjoy the journey of growing as a person. I am grateful I am human and have my strengths and flaws. Life is never boring for me.

I am a moderate INFJ with enneagram type 4 who is into attachment style psychology. I think deeply before I act. When I warm up I love to smile and bring out the best in people because that's what makes me feel my very best.

I like...

Soaring off the ground with the crow yoga pose, seeking new adventures through lush forests, rough trails or sandy beaches, optimizing my health through nutrition care and cultivating the food forest I wish to indulge in and share.

I'd love to immerse myself into a engaging and deep conversation on a night out at the beach and bond over some steak and fine wine. I like learning new things about others and I value spending good quality time and cherishing the moment. 

I appreciate when my date...

I love it when my date knows what they want and expresses their needs, has a great sense of curiosity, love being around family and are open minded. Also appreciate it when my date likes taking things slow to form a genuine connection between us and encourage a strong connection to ourselves.

- Today my Discover section became completely blank.
- When I ""like"" or ""pass"" someone, the app freezes and doesn't show me the next profile. I have to restart the app to see the next profile.
- When I get a new match or a new message and I go into the app to look, most times I can't even see it in my Chats section. I have to restart the app to see.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"A guy I was really excited to meet for our first socially distance date (where we’d do an easy hike while wearing masks) mentioned to me that the day before we meet, he is going on another date with an ICU doctor who treats coronavirus patients. He wanted me to know so that I could decide if I still wanted to meet IRL or to do a video chat. I think it’s sweet that he cared enough to allow me to make a choice about my safety and I am staying with an asthmatic roommate so I appreciate his transparency soo much, but I’m just completely turned off now. 

Not sure if it’s because he mentioned another person (which yes, yes, it’s a first date, but I like to pretend there’s no one else. Like in normal times, it’d be rude to be like “oh I’m going out with someone else on the first date) or if I’m just put off because idk how much you can trust another person will really socially distance on a date if it goes well. I hadn’t thought of it that much, but now I’m like really concerned. I know personally know two nurses who got the virus despite all precautions. And it’s not a diss, I have family who are also healthcare workers and we have purposefully not even seen each other, they are isolating from family because they do not want to risk spreading to family especially after seeing what happened to the two nurses. I don’t think it’s fair to ask this doctor not to live life, but I’m also afraid. 

Anyway, I asked to FaceTime instead, but now I’m just thinking, eh, let’s just scrap it all. The doctor is awesome enough for him to risk it and I’m just not excited about the date anymore. I should add we lost a great aunt to the virus and it was awful all around so maybe that’s why I’m just extra worried. Like it’s made me not want to date because it made me realize not everyone would tell me they were in contact with someone on the front line.

&lt;li&gt;Facebook &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone Number &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Says “sorry we weren’t able to verify your account”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contacted customer support. 
They responded with some General automated response telling me to try resetting privacy date
Clear cookies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tried everything. And can’t create account.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contacted customer service weeks ago.  Three times. 
No response. 
They must have no customer service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have zen desk email service set up , yet absolutely no response.  This is a shit company apparently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also left a terrible review on the App Store to see if it’ll get their attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolute. &lt;/p&gt;

,coffeemeetsbagel,"     I lay down to go to sleep and started going through my daily bagels before I called it a night. The very first profile I was presented with was a woman who stood out to me a bit but I ended up choosing not to like her profile, a decision which I found myself regretting after I had already made the decision.

I continued on and after I had worked through all the profiles I was presented with for the day, I decided to go back and look at the pictures of someone who I had matched with last year, gotten to know, and eventually became friends with. We live kind of far apart and haven’t been able to see each other often especially with the virus since she lives in a very populated area, so thought I’d look at the pictures on her profile to try to better cement what she looks like in my head. 

I scrolled through her pictures briefly but then noticed that even though I had exhausted all my potential matches for the day, I suddenly had one extra one, As indicated by the little red number one. I went to the suggested tab and lo and behold, the person that I regretted declining was back! I made sure sending a like was what I wanted to do, and went for it. 

Just kind of a fun story so I thought I’d share.

In a nutshell: I wanted to RAVE about this awesome guy that I matched with on the app. Then I was like, wait, I’ll just write a REVIEW b/c ppl are always saying that this app is a crock a hooey.  Then I got ghosted by this mofo and now I have a little RANT to sprinkle on top of everything else….

First 48 hours: amazing—vibes on vibes on vibes.  

Day 5: Totally disconnecting. This is about the time that I didn’t enthusiastically support us meeting up that Friday night (pardon me and my pandemic paranoias).This is where I felt the momentum shift. Saturday was weird and quiet...I think we exchanged some gifs which were like the virtual equivalent of weather talk on the bus (bantering at it’s worse). Definitely didn’t see him taking the f\*\*kboy route and just like never texting or calling me ever again. Like wtf?? This dude is supposed to be 38 years old. There was no bad energy between us. Quite frankly I wasn’t interested in being his rebound chick ANYWAYS, so I was kind of hoping for an “out”….but ya know...an “out” with some sort of “in”...cause this dude is yummy...so maybe like a ‘pause’. Like I wanted to ‘save my game’ so I could return to where I left off but he was like ‘nope-game over’.

So even if he wanted nothing to do with me (which is fine-I’m grown-I’ll survive), I still expected to ‘part ways’ of some sort. Now I can’t even use him as ‘that’ figment of my imagination when I’m self pleasuring because I gotta file him away in my mind as THAT ass who ghosted me. His image has negative connotations. Grrr. Who can climax with that. What’s up with not providing a lady with a little clarity? Even I send a few carefully arranged emojis before I unmatch a guy. Sometimes it’s the peace sign and the upside down smiley face. Maybe even a thumbs down and 1-3 poop emojis. I thought the guys on here were supposed to be classier. So much for bagels. They are more like pop tarts. I’m the coffee right?

Day 7: By the time the chat was to expire it was clear we weren’t as in tune w/one another. Me not knowing entirely wtf was up and giving dude his space to ‘do him’ that weekend, went ahead and extended the chat another 3 days. At this point I’m not sure what the nature of the disconnect is but since he’s all yummy n shit I’m like, what’s a few hundred beans and a little embarrassment (should he be passively waiting for the chat to expire).

Day 10: Chat is set to expire again. By now I’m like “whatever-this guy can kick rocks”. So naturally... I extend the chat again. Cause Brain/Bod=yummy. And just in case this yum mofo is super preoccupied (vs flat out not into me….60/40?) I didnt want to NOT extend it….ya know...in case I still had a shot w/ McYummy. The next day he goes all Casper on me. But for 29 extra days I get to test my will power in not looking at all the updates to his profile. Thank you CMB I didn’t even have to pay for the beans.   

I personally don’t understand what all the complaining is about. I realize that it is a different experience for the men on here but I don’t think the women necessarily have more benefits. I remember when this thing got pitched on Shark Tank. It’s definitely not an immediate gratification type dating app. Think slow boat to Ch---nevermind. Nonetheless eventually you arrive. It sometimes feels like a more ‘wholesome’ environment to meet a match. As if this is where all the nice guys and gals go. The kind of app you’re not afraid to tell co-workers you’re on...if they’ve heard of it. I wouldn’t make it my ‘main-app’ though. I think it works best as a side piece. That way you don’t have to invest in beans. You check in a few times a month. Tap a few hearts.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Recently I met a scammer from CMB Australia, who claims to be handsome ( use other people's images), successful ( show me how many bitcoins he has) and responsible ( he said he was looking for a relationship right in the beginning ).

He kept talking about how successful and how knowledgeable he is about cryptocurrency. He tried to convince me to invest with him and deposit fund to a platform called [YAOUBTT.COM/.NET](https://yaoubtt.com/.NET). I sensed it is a huge red flag and did my own research and read reviews from Trustpilot and Reddit. There are other scamming websites as well, Yaoubtt is just an example. Rule of Thumb: asking you for money? Block them!

Apparently they all claim to be living in HK/ or some big cities in Asia and have been investing for many years. I believe they are from HK as well. Long story short, they all sound too good to be true.

I think scammers have their own way of explaining/finding excuses, let's just be alert and be aware of those people

1. he is using a UK number instead of an Australian mobile number
2. he asked your mobile and added you on WhatsApp straightaway. ( I didn't think it was an issue in the beginning because I think WhatsApp is easier to chat ) 
3. their profile pic is never to be ""HIMSELF"" as he /she is using the same number talking to others pretending to be someone else at the same time
4. He/She has a sad story
5. He/She really know how to talk to you and makes your heart melt. I guess we should really learn from them 
6. He/she can be knowledgeable in some area, the guy I was talking to is knowledgeable about cryptocurrency. Now I am quite interested after 2 weeks and would like to know more about it :)

Lessons learnt

\- don't get into the illusion of ""love"" from online dating too soon, you gotta meet he/she first

\- don't let money be involved in online dating / maybe off-line dating as well. if they ask you for money, something is wrong...red flag, don't find excuses for them because He/she is good looking and attractive. you could be talking to a pig :P

,coffeemeetsbagel,"TL;DR: Should I give the CMB guy who only wants to make out and does NOT want a serious relationship my first kiss? Will my future boyfriend think I'm too ""casual""?

Please refer to my previous post about this guy I met on CMB who dated me 10+ times on-day and failed because I was occupied/not feeling ready: [https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeemeetsbagel/comments/giclse/after\_not\_texting\_for\_a\_week\_should\_i\_find\_him/](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeemeetsbagel/comments/giclse/after_not_texting_for_a_week_should_i_find_him/)

Thank you for all the comments on my previous post. I have taken up the courage to ask him out because I don't want him to be mistaken that I'm not interested by rejecting his proposed dates for 10+ times.

Short summary of previous post: I met this guy on CMB and we chatted for about 2 months. During this period, he has asked me on dates for roughly 15 times. I know. It's a lot. But he only asked ON-DAY (only one date which was fixed about 3 days before). He simply couldn't expect me to be free all the time and immediately available, right? Plus my busy 6-day working schedule. I only have one day-off to dress nicer to meet him. So we never had our first date. He went cold after I rejected him for the 14th time. More details on the post I've linked above.

Last Sunday, I had dinner plan with my friend but I was out shopping (no COVID lockdowns/quarantines in my town because of little to no local cases). About 2 hours before I met my friend, I casually texted him ""What are your plans for today?"" He said ""Nothing much"" and he was near the area where the seafront was (where he suggested going on dates before). I was trying out clothes in the fitting room so I didn't reply immediately. 20 minutes later, he texted me if I would like to come over to meet him.

I said ""Sure haha"", ""but it takes about 45 minutes for me to come, would you be in a rush?"". He said ""it's all fine"". I went to re-apply my makeup. I was really ready to meet him, but then when I looked at the mirror, my dry skin flaked so much. I couldn't fix it with my makeup. I really did not want to meet him with this dry skin. So about 15 minutes later, I said I could not come because of the dry skin problem (yes I'm honest like that) and if it's okay to meet on Friday night (because I'm occupied from Mon-Thurs). He told me not to worry about the dry skin, ""Friday's not good"", ""Let's meet now"". I insisted and said sorry I really couldn't come and I want to see him in my best condition. Then he got annoyed and said forget it and he's used to all this. He said I have excuses every time. I apologised and said I wanted to meet him too. But I've got dinner plan with my friend later anyway. Let's meet later. He said ""never mind"", ""then maybe we're probably not gonna meet"". I was standing outside the shop, shocked. I didn't expect him to reply like this. I just sent him those crying stickers and said sorry. He then said ""bye"". And that's it.

I texted him that night at around 11pm because I wanted it to be fixed and not let the problem sit there overnight. I said ""Are you still angry?"" Then he replied the next day afternoon, PLOT TWIST ALERT! He said he's not angry but ""let's forget it"", ""I'm not the right guy for you"", ""If we meet and I want to hug and kiss, you won't accept this."" I was so SHOCKED. I did imagine making out with him when we meet but I don't expect him to be so explicit. He knows that I am a relationship virgin btw, so maybe that's why he thinks I can't take that.

I replied him ""I think it all comes very naturally."", ""If I feel like it I think it's okay."", and asked him if he hugged and kissed all the girls he met on first dates. He said he didn't date a lot of girls but most of them would do so. I was really so stunned. Then I asked him if they were together afterwards. He said they didn't so I won't like it. I then asked him ""Why? Because you don't feel the connection?"" He said maybe, and asked me if I could send him more photos. I did not respond to his photo request and asked him if he was looking for a girlfriend. He didn't answer directly but half-admitted by saying ""that's why I said I'm not right haha"". Then I replied ""let's forget it then"". He said ""Okay"".

So we didn't text ever since. I was wondering if I should ask him out and ""hug and kiss"" with him as he wished? Actually I did have some sexual fantasy about him so I did imagine hugging and kissing him way before he told me it was his usual practice. I know he was not a good boyfriend material so I don't like him that way now. I don't want to have a serious relationship with him but I am thinking if I should ""practise"" kissing someone? So I won't be another year older to have my first kiss? I know this is stupid but I want to do this... am I stupid?

&amp;#x200B;

Things that bother me and make me indecisive:

\- Would he still accept going on ""date"" with me if I asked him so? (given my flakey record and unavailability, I'm afraid of rejections...)

\- Would my future boyfriend mind that my first kiss was not even given to a boyfriend, but a random guy who only wants to make out? (I know I can lie about it, but I don't want to)

\- Would he want MORE than ""hug and kiss""? I am only ready for hug and kiss...

\- Would he ""blackmail"" me by secretly taking photos/asking sb to take photos of us kissing? or showing our messages (my invitation messages) to people?

I was trying out clothes in the fitting room so I didn&amp;#39;t reply immediately. 20 minutes later, he texted me if I would like to come over to meet him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said &amp;quot;Sure haha&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;but it takes about 45 minutes for me to come, would you be in a rush?&amp;quot;. He said &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s all fine&amp;quot;. I went to re-apply my makeup. I was really ready to meet him, but then when I looked at the mirror, my dry skin flaked so much. I couldn&amp;#39;t fix it with my makeup. I really did not want to meet him with this dry skin. So about 15 minutes later, I said I could not come because of the dry skin problem (yes I&amp;#39;m honest like that) and if it&amp;#39;s okay to meet on Friday night (because I&amp;#39;m occupied from Mon-Thurs). He told me not to worry about the dry skin, &amp;quot;Friday&amp;#39;s not good&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s meet now&amp;quot;. I insisted and said sorry I really couldn&amp;#39;t come and I want to see him in my best condition. Then he got annoyed and said forget it and he&amp;#39;s used to all this. He said I have excuses every time. I apologised and said I wanted to meet him too. But I&amp;#39;ve got dinner plan with my friend later anyway. Let&amp;#39;s meet later. He said &amp;quot;never mind&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;then maybe we&amp;#39;re probably not gonna meet&amp;quot;. I was standing outside the shop, shocked. I didn&amp;#39;t expect him to reply like this. I just sent him those crying stickers and said sorry. He then said &amp;quot;bye&amp;quot;. And that&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I texted him that night at around 11pm because I wanted it to be fixed and not let the problem sit there overnight. I said &amp;quot;Are you still angry?&amp;quot; Then he replied the next day afternoon, PLOT TWIST ALERT! He said he&amp;#39;s not angry but &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s forget it&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not the right guy for you&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;If we meet and I want to hug and kiss, you won&amp;#39;t accept this.&amp;quot; I was so SHOCKED. I did imagine making out with him when we meet but I don&amp;#39;t expect him to be so explicit. He knows that I am a relationship virgin btw, so maybe that&amp;#39;s why he thinks I can&amp;#39;t take that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replied him &amp;quot;I think it all comes very naturally.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;If I feel like it I think it&amp;#39;s okay.&amp;quot;, and asked him if he hugged and kissed all the girls he met on first dates. He said he didn&amp;#39;t date a lot of girls but most of them would do so. I was really so stunned. Then I asked him if they were together afterwards. He said they didn&amp;#39;t so I won&amp;#39;t like it. I then asked him &amp;quot;Why? Because you don&amp;#39;t feel the connection?&amp;quot; He said maybe, and asked me if I could send him more photos. I did not respond to his photo request and asked him if he was looking for a girlfriend. He didn&amp;#39;t answer directly but half-admitted by saying &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s why I said I&amp;#39;m not right haha&amp;quot;. Then I replied &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s forget it then&amp;quot;. He said &amp;quot;Okay&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we didn&amp;#39;t text ever since. I was wondering if I should ask him out and &amp;quot;hug and kiss&amp;quot; with him as he wished? Actually I did have some sexual fantasy about him so I did imagine hugging and kissing him way before he told me it was his usual practice. I know he was not a good boyfriend material so I don&amp;#39;t like him that way now. I don&amp;#39;t want to have a serious relationship with him but I am thinking if I should &amp;quot;practise&amp;quot; kissing someone? So I won&amp;#39;t be another year older to have my first kiss? I know this is stupid but I want to do this... am I stupid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that bother me and make me indecisive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Would he still accept going on &amp;quot;date&amp;quot; with me if I asked him so? (given my flakey record and unavailability, I&amp;#39;m afraid of rejections...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Would my future boyfriend mind that my first kiss was not even given to a boyfriend, but a random guy who only wants to make out? (I know I can lie about it, but I don&amp;#39;t want to)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Would he want MORE than &amp;quot;hug and kiss&amp;quot;? I am only ready for hug and kiss...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Would he &amp;quot;blackmail&amp;quot; me by secretly taking photos/asking sb to take photos of us kissing? or showing our messages (my invitation messages) to people? (my imaginations are so wild)&lt;/p&gt;

The algorithm does wonders when separating the most desired (Discovery) users to the lesser ones (Suggested)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If by chance you meet someone you like in Suggested, you probably need to send flowers(money/beans) to jump the line or wait 10 days &amp;amp; hope they aren’t flooded with messages to notice you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even asked customer support about what happens to your daily likes if you don’t check in every day, &amp;amp; I got a round about answer that made me think they were avoiding the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least Tinder doesn’t pretend to be anything but superficial. My 2 cents.&lt;/p&gt;

,coffeemeetsbagel,"TL;DR: Should I initiate our convo after we both kinda flaked on our first date and not texted for a week now?

I am 23, he is 27. We met on CMB and texted for over a month. He asked me out **LAST MINUTE(!)** for like **10+** times but I was either too busy, too lazy or feeling ugly so I rejected them all. (I really prefer dates planned at least a day ahead rather than impromptu ones) He asked me to propose a date so I picked Saturday and he agreed. (P.S. I just got a soul-sucking job that required working 6 days/week so I took a Saturday leave for our ""first date"". He didn't know about my pathetic work schedule though. He only knew I got a new job.)

No text during the day on Friday so I assumed the date was off :'(

On **Friday 11pm**, he texted me asking me where I wanna go tmr, and I replied ""You decide :p"" and asked him when he was available. He said he was available **in the afternoon**. A few mins later, he asked me if I would like to go for **lunch** or **dinner**. (So I assumed he was available **BOTH** in the **afternoon** and at **night** right??)

I only have a sad lil weekly day-off so I planned to squeeze my social (distancing) activities in one day - meet my friend **in the afternoon** and meet him **in the evening**. I replied to him **THE NEXT DAY 10am**(*did I reply too late?*) that I am available at 6pm. An hour later he said he couldn't make it if it's tonight... so I replied ""Oh okay then...""

TBH I was pretty pissed because I took my leave **FOR HIM**. I thought he was available **BOTH** in the **afternoon** and at **night.** Did he suddenly have a date with an unknown girl?! :(

Later that night he asked me what I did today and I replied hanging out with friend and trying out a restaurant. I asked him back and he said he went to an island nearby with his high school friend. He sent me a photo of him putting his hands in his pockets (*okay he's pretty muscular*) at the beach with blue sky, the kind of photo that's pretty *Insta*. He asked me if the food was nice.

And here we go, I replied ""Really nice weather lol"" and ""Very yummy :p"" *(Did I make a mistake not complimenting him? I actually did. I whispered* ***so muscular*** *when I saw it... Though now thinking about it, I would also feel sad if I sent a guy my photo and he only commented on the background.)*

He only replied to my ""Very yummy"" message with a thumbs-up cute pug sticker **the next morning**, and THAT'S IT.

THAT'S IT.

He used to text me good morning and goodnight, asked me about my day EVERYDAY. He would double text me if I haven't replied for long. I expected he would text me later but no... NOTHING. So I really put up my A-game, 2 days later I replied to the sticker with ""So cute"". And...

He did not reply.

Now one week has passed, should I text him? It would really bruise my ego (even more) if he doesn't reply/reply unenthusiastically.

P.S. I am a relationship virgin as if you couldn't tell already.. I really thought we had a chance and I could finally get into a relationship like EVER.

UPDATE: I know not meeting up is the best during this time, but in my country the number of local cases is 0 for quite a number of days, and we both still have to go to work at office everyday so I think it is acceptable if we BOTH wear masks when we meet.

UPDATE 2: I messaged him and he responded. But he sounds less warm than he used to... maybe he has met other girl(s) in these roughly 10 days. No date is mentioned yet... because I'm not even sure if he is interested to see me now.

The question just won't escape me especially with everything I keep seeing following the Twitter and Instagram posts from apps like CMB and Hinge and their push for virtual dates. 

Let's say you are virtual dating right now and have narrowed it down to one person that you're talking to consistently. At some point, based on how strict stay at home orders are where you live and if you're in a low-risk category with no pre-existing conditions, aren't you better off going on an IRL date with that person sooner than later? Why let something drag out months that may seem like it's going great behind a screen but ultimately have no chemistry with them in the real world?

End Nov, someone liked me and started the chat by exchanging nationality. He claims to be a Singaporean Chinese working in the UK and coming back next month. What's odd is that... he doesn't understand singlish (despite saying that he has a family in Singapore). The chat window was ending so he added me on Line. He also claimed that he has a house in marina sands, but he doesn't know the answer to ""Which MRT is that?"" By then, I am sure that this guy is super fake. He also nags for my whatsapp number. Additionally, his English is poorly written (how can someone who's working in the UK be that bad?)

Mid Jan, 46 years old claiming to be an Indonesian American and working in Singapore. When I told him that I'd prefer to meet in person, he said that he's traveling to US that night. Also asked for Whatsapp number. I concluded, this guy is another fake.

March, another person claiming to be a Singaporean who grow up in Australia but working in Hapag-Lloyd, Cambodia. No more lousy chit chat, I ask for a proof for a real being. No answer. CMB then adding a text saying that this user is flagged for possibly violating terms.

March, another person said interested but again, claiming to be in Singapore but left to Indonesia. 

I submit to you that there are just too many fake users with questionable intentions in CMB. They all have certain patterns:

1. Their English language usage is simple and sometimes terrible (you can also see from how they write their profile)
2. Fail to prove as a human being by saying ""I don't use Facebook"" or their account is hacked. If they ask for your Whatsapp number, don't give it until you verify everything. Use another chat app.

,coffeemeetsbagel," Hi,

I'm working on building a new dating app with the intention of meeting people rather quickly once matching (48 hours). It is my experience that the longer things go without meeting the chances of ever meeting decrease by A LOT!

I really don't have time to waste or chat forever without meeting IRL! I'm sure you agree too.

So I'm building an MVP and basically the way it works is that to avoid getting stood up or chatting forever and never going on a date, I'm setting a timer where once you start chatting with your match you have 48 hours to set a date. MVP also suggests date locations to avoid those convos of ""Come over to my place, I don't have roommates"" (I'm not that easy, hun) and you can soft-track to venue so you \*know\* you're not about to get ghosted/stood up.

Matching will be based on location, mutual interests, and NO SWIPING! Oh yeah and the soft-track to venue just means each party will see the distance they're to the location. As a woman myself, I understand this is of great concern, so I'm thinking of adding a feature where you share your date details via SMS to like a friend or trusted contact.

**TL;DR You match, trigger a timer to set a date within 48 hours of starting chat, you set location with the help of app suggesting venues/themes, you soft-track to venue, enjoy your date!**

I’m fairly new to this app, and was wondering if this ever happened to any of you. FYI, I reached out to customer service at CMB about this matter, but they have not answered.

A couple days ago, I saw a (male) bagel I really liked on Discover, so I was brave enough to take it. As soon as I “took” him, his profile dissipated into thin air. No chat room formed. Never to be seen on Discover tab again. So sad.

Just yesterday, I saw another bagel who I liked enough to “take” and also do a little experiment for curiosity’s sake -- I hit “like,” his profile got stamped “LIKED,” I got a chatroom where I guess I could initiate our conversation, and his profile is still floating in my Discover tab.

Gender: Male

Mood: Random

Sexuality: Straight

Status: Single

Medical Condition: Asperger Syndrome (Autistic)

Slightly

My Personality: People describe me as nice, kind, considerate, helpful, and funny, I am also a bit of an introvert

Things I Dislike: Rudeness, Chores, Loneliness, and my parents.

Some of my hobbies include: PC Gaming, building computers and DIY Projects.

Why I’m here: To make new friends who accept me for who I am and not what they want me to be.

PS: I can be a bit shy at times when I first meet people. I'm not really a good conversation starter. Also I don't like people judging me and getting nervous about why I want what im about to say. The thing that i want is a girl that would let me touch her hair but when I ask and if its ok with them ill do it but thats what im super nervous about is people thinking im a creap when i touch girls hair. I also want someone I can hangout a lot with.

Fun Fact: Im autistic partially and ive created a working Game Maker Studio 2D platformer Space Shooter game with a story in under 6 months. This was a group project of 3 people but my partners blew me off and I had to do the whole project myself. It was cool I learned alot from programming a game. I just wish i had some help with it. But I did get the best score out of all the other projects.

I have an essay about the positive aspect of my past life experience just ask and ill share the link with you.

&lt;p&gt;I have an essay about the positive aspect of my past life experience just ask and ill share the link with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have the negative aspect of my past life experience just ask and ill share the link with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get to know me please ping or DM me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What im looking is for a friend or maybe a date someone 18 and up idk but someone who has similar traits to mine and is very open minded and respectful. No smokers/drug users i will stop talking to you immediately if i see you do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

1. MISSING CHAT MESSAGES IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. How do you mess up the most crucial part of a dating app and just ignore it for years? Multiple times I have sent an outgoing message that simply does not show up in my chat window, and I have no idea whether the other person received it and it's just missing on my end. How do I know if I'm about to send two messages about the same thing and she got both? Embarrassing. 
EVEN WORSE, a match will send me a message, and though I'll get a notification and see the preview of the message in my notifications bar, when I open the app to read the message isn't there! I'm left confused as to whether I got a message or not - until hours or even days later when the message finally shows up, and it looks to my match like I've just ignored her. Even more embarrassing. 
These happened in many memorable instances years ago when I first started using the app... it also happened this week with a new match, in both directions. I absolutely do not trust CMB to facilitate communication.  

2. STUCK ON LOADING SCREEN EVERY APP OPEN. I mean this happens EVERY SINGLE TIME I open the app, whether its been properly closed before or just switching back. The blue loading screen with the logo in white will stay open and showing even though nothing is loading, until I hit my phone's 'back' button, whereupon it immediately leaves the loading screen. It doesn't break essential functionality like problem 1 does, but holy hell is it annoying, and it really speaks to the quality of your dev team.

3. UNWANTED **CONSTANT** PUSH NOTIFICATIONS. You give 3 options for granular notifications control in Settings. I have only one selected, 'Chats'. So why am I getting **literally 5-10 notifications per da**y that have nothing to do with receiving new chat messages? I really dont want multiple reminders that I should send each person I match with another message, or to break the ice, or that it's f\*\*\*g 'Watermelon Day' or whatever pathetic attention grabbing message CMB marketing is trying out. It has the opposite of the intended effect - now I just ignore my CMB notifications, and I'm about to disable them altogether, meaning I won't know if I actually got a new chat message until I manually check.

On dating apps it's pretty typical for guys to post their shirtless pics to show off their bodies.

For guys, what motivates you to post them? And what are your objectives on CMB (serious relationship, casual dating, strictly hookups, seeing where things go, etc.)?

No judgement, you want what you want, right? 😆

For girls, what are your thoughts when you see a guy with a shirtless pic on his profile? Are you more likely to like them or to swipe left?

Me, personally, I feel like you probably are looking for hookups if you do this (excluding things like beach pics or something). I usually think this more so if you have multiple shirtless pictures and hardly any bio...so then I swipe left lol.

I (Asian 31M) started a CMB profile few months ago without much success (2 matches in 1 month, both times the other person stopped responding after two or three messages)

Anyways, I want to restart my account and get more serious about finding a potential partner this year. Without any prior experience with online dating aside from that one month dabbling around,  I would like to get some inputs from the more experienced folks here.

Any suggestions are welcome

Thanks!

So far:

22 matches

15 first messages sent (14 by me, 1 by a match!)

12 responses

10 ""real"" conversations

3 dates planned so far, though I suspect all of the conversations could lead to dates

1 conversation I had given up on; we exchanged 2-3 messages each after matching and nothing otherwise until she suddenly gave me her number right before the chat expired. I'm not sure what to make of this.

The age of my matches range from 25-32, although the vast majority fall between 28-30.

In hindsight, using the app around Christmas was probably not the best idea as most people are busy and traveling, myself included.

For more context, I haven't used dating apps in over 2 years (recently ended a relationship), so this is pretty overwhelming.

I'm really curious how others juggle this many matches, especially from the female side of things as I assume women usually have significantly more matches. I actually feel pretty bad in general.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Hi all,

Earlier this year, a friend recommended Coffee Meets Bagel to me, and I thought I would give it a try.

I found it quite disappointing.  
None of the 'suggested bagels' the app gave me daily interested me, so I often liked guys who were in the ""discover"" section (or whatever it's called, I forget now). I would frequently run out of ""coffee beans"" before they got refilled, and I was constantly finding ways to get more beans, but sometimes I still did not have enough.

One day, I noticed a guy who was outside of my suggested bagels who I was really, REALLY interested in based on his bio, his basic information including education, age, etc, and his appearance. I also happen to have a rather unusual...preference, shall we say, and he happened to be someone who could accommodate that based on his bio. Here's the thing, though. I did not have enough coffee beans to like him, so I had to buy them.  
I was very upset that I had to pay for said ""beans"". Even though it was not a lot of money, it was still money that I--spoiler alert--ended up losing. You guys, I could have bought an \*actual\* coffee with this money, but no, it went to waste.  
I feel strongly that it is unacceptable for a dating app to charge money to like someone if you don't have enough 'beans'. I have tried a handful of other dating apps and while they do have features you do have to pay for, this is the only app I have ever used that required me to pay for liking someone, and I ended up losing the money.

Have any of you had a similar experience? What are your thoughts?

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Just thought I'd share this story because I found it kinda funny/ridiculous.   


Awhile ago, I got matched with this guy who sent me 3 flowers through the app, so it got pushed to the front of my queue. Because of that, it did manage to get my attention, and he seemed like a charming guy from his profile and photos, so we ended up exchanging info to carry out conversation via text. 

I actually texted him first, but as a disclaimer, I told him I'm not the greatest texter because of work and when I get home, a lot of times I just leave my phone in my purse to work on YouTube projects on my computer. Video editing has been a passion project for me lately so I just don't wait by my phone that much. But still! I become a lot better when I am actively texting with someone because of CMB.  


But after that first text, he sends me a text the next day like 'ok cool.' I thought it was so bizarre that I found a worst texter than me. I respond pretty quickly to that (only like an hour and legitly because I didn't see it until then), but then it's like another day before he responds.    


We were finally trying to schedule a meetup but when I asked him the details, he took another half day to respond. I responded pretty much right after that because I knew he must be near his phone at that point. Then it's morning of the supposed date when he finally responds, and at that point, I'm just irritated because I can't be expected to shift everything that day (Saturday) to accommodate his last-minuteness. I suggest the next day, Sunday anytime, and I figure if he can't work with that, I don't think I'd want to be with him anyway since he doesn't seem to value my time / schedule.  


We finally meet up and it was alright, but then I tell him it's really bizarre how he has probably a worse texting habit than I do. Then he says that he actually has his phone next to him all the time. He just responds like that because I said my responses would be like that.   


LOL WTF.   


First off, I actually responded to him quite quickly. I think the most it took me to respond was like two hours and when we were trying to figure out the date details, it was like 10 minutes. He took 6 hours, 8 hrs, etc. to respond to me.  

Second of all - I always respond when I see the message. I just wanted to say upfront when I get busy, don't get freaked if I don't respond right away. I knew some guys who did and took it as a sign I wasn't interested. I just honestly get really busy!!  


Needless to say, I left that date with no intention in following up with him despite him wanting to. I guess I have to respect that he was honest telling me he is always on his phone, but I do not respect the fact that he was interested but didn't text until very calculated blocks of time passed. You might call me the asshole for not  being the greatest texter first, but that's a flaw I'm working on.

An example scenario:

Date 1: Given 2 options, kept simple for scoping purposes. Let's skip discussion on this one, because presumably, I want to get to know this person better. 

Date 2: Given 2 options: A) Go out dancing (Teach her stuff before going out), B) Go running together; Both active endeavors

Date 3: 4 Options: A) Jazz bar + slow dancing, B) Coffee shop with games, C) Dance class, D) Park + active games

Date 4: 5 Options: A) Dance social, B) Take interesting dance class together, C) Food truck festival, D) Park + Active games, E) Rock climbing

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Perhaps venting so please disregard if you do not find useful.

Two things specifically I do not like about CMB as a male:

1) Women seem to be the primary customers of the platform itself, while men are the product - height, ethnicity, and profession are recommended/required data points (social capital) but there's no requirement for bust-waist-hip measurements or current weight or body fat ratios (sexual capital). While the dominance of  photos infers all this information, there's no requirement that the photos be current, structured to showcase body physical features (i.e. 360 degree full-body), nor is there any sortability of physical data aside from height (in this respect at least OKC was honest enough to include an attempt at ""attractiveness/hotness"" in their premium offerings). While both social and sexual capital are important, in my experience the majority genders view the priority of each differently.

2) The ""likes you"" tab is aimed at women and is evidence of the economic incentive structure - My understanding is that men receive a large pool of generic/calculated suggestions while women only see suggestions that have already ""liked"" first and in a far lower quantity, with a significant portion overflowing into the ""Discover"" tab. If that's the case then the only majority gender to benefit from this tab functionality will be women.

One overarching big major takeaway from the whole idea of dating platforms in general:

By FAR the biggest take-away from this kind of software design to me is how poorly this Silicon Valley-style ""innovation"" compares with the actual social concept of dating itself.
