Tinder,"Does a bloody nose picture have any significance? I’ve seen multiple girls with bloody nose pictures on tinder. Does this mean something? I hooked up with one that had a bloody nose pic and she said she was a neophile, or nymphomaniac or sum shit idrk. Was this what the bloody nose alluded to?"
Tinder,people dissapeared from likes sent? basically the title. I like or superlike someone and they just dont show up or do but then dissapear from the likes sent tab. I thought it meant that they swiped left but I've matched with a few later. Does anyone know why this happens?
Tinder,"question for people on subreddit, how I start a conversation for a macth I think that simply ""hello"" already in case most of the time does not give to continue the conversation with some girls and I do not know if it is very uncomfortable to start giving a compliment in a photo is the key, also the girls with whom it matches They are between 18 to 30 because I am 22 years old and sorry for my English I still do not master it very well.

￼"
Tinder,"I put in the wrong DOB and now I can’t even delete my account I’m 20, and I accidentally put in my DOB as 2008. Now it’s saying I have to wait 1856 days before I can make an account. I’m not seeing any options to delete the account and put in my actual DOB. Any ideas?"
Tinder,"What should I say to signal I’m looking for a hookup? I just got a girls snap from tinder and I’m really interested, what should I do to signal I’m interested in a hookup?"
Tinder,"OKAY SO I BROKE THE CODE... I don’t know if anybody has posted this yet. On Tinder when you first open the app, the first one is always a “popular user.” Then the second is always a match if you have someone who has liked you, and you haven’t already disliked them. This works if you close the app on your phone then open it again so it scans. Try it and check if it works."
Tinder,"Tinder cancelled my account and subscription Signed up to Gold for six months two weeks ago. Literally got zero match in 2 weeks and for buyer remorse but hey.

Last night I received an email from Tinder saying they've processed a refund IN FULL (not pro-rated) of my subscription.

Then I went on to check my profile in the app and they closed it so I need to create a new one from scratch, which I probably won't.

Not that I'm complaining but has this happened to anyone else? My pics must have been so fugly that they took pity lol"
Tinder,"Using Tinder in the US I'm currently using tinder in the US, and while my pictures are pretty decent and my profile not that cranky, almost nobody swipes right for me. This is very weird considering that I could match with people normally back in my home country, and now it seems nobody is interested. Is this a US thing, or just tough luck? What am I missing here?"
Tinder,"How picky should you be when swiping? I’ve seen a lot of mixed advice on this, with some saying it’s best to be very picky for the algorithm while others say swiping right a lot results in more people seeing your profile. Thoughts?"
Tinder,"What should I put in my profile to signal I want hookups? I’m getting bored af and I’m looking to get some hookups here at college, what should I put in my pictures/bio to attract more of that?"
Tinder,Run out of potential matches? So I was only a little bit this morning and stopped and reopened tinder. I only got shown one girl and then ran out of potential matches. How is this possible and what happened to the girls that were in my stack this morning?
Tinder,"Should I make a new Profile? So me and some friends are going to go out soon and hang out downtown, and I’m going to use this opportunity to get some actually decent pictures for my profile. Well I’m not a 100% sure how Tinder works but I was wondering if it’s worth making a new account over since I’ve seen a lot of people already."
Tinder,"Cropping sucks Why every time I crop a picture, I cannot use anything on the left side. Crop magnets to the right and it’s frustrating coz I finally have a decent photo and I can’t use it for some unknown reason"
Tinder,"Not Near Me It seems like at least 50% of the photos I see are very far from me.  
Some say ""15 mi"", but then go on to say some city 100s miles away.  
Is this just how it works ?"
Tinder,"Can Tinder be useful in my case?  Hi.  I'm a curious European guy 28 yo and I like mainly girls. But I also want to try oral  sex giving with man of uncommon type - trusty, polite and honest. How to find such guy in Europe?"
Tinder,"Likes from another person gone?! Been a user for this app after deleting and installing the app. Today I found out I had someone like me. Felt good, check it out and found the picture matching the like. I hit like back and it tells me to message her. So I decided to check her profile, but all it did was close the app. I join back in hoping I still can message her but the match is gone. So idk if it chose to remove the Like I had made when I wanted to get info to start the conversation. Does this happen to anyone else?"
Tinder,A Rested Soul Listen to the most recent episode of my podcast: A Rested Soul https://anchor.fm/fulloflifesd/episodes/A-Rested-Soul-esboen
Tinder,"messaging again after ghosting Hey, i'm after a bit of advice if anyone can help, so a bit of context;

Matched with this girl about a month ago, we had good banter for about a week and then it slowly fizzled away. The last few days of messaging It felt like I was putting more effort into the conversation so I just let the conversation naturally run to an end, but technically I was ghosted as my message was last one haha. The only confusing thing is she accepted my request to add her on insta (it was in her bio) around the time we stopped talking. She doesn't post very frequently so the whole 'using tinder for likes' thing doesn't seem to apply. She's also viewed my one and only story on insta that I posted recently (i barely use insta but had some news to share).

So basically I want to try restarting to conversation. How would you go about messaging again after a month of no conversation? I just want to shoot my shot again because why not, but at the same time i'm cool if she's not interested and don't want to come across desperate. Any advice would be appreciated. cheers"
Tinder,How do I change my tinder password? I just found out that my ex has access to my tinder account and she has been unmatching my matches. How do I go about changing the password?
Tinder,"Does anyone keep a repository of their ex’s phone numbers? If you’ve previously gone on a date with a girl and it ended there or you used to be in a relationship, do you keep the number or block/delete? 

An ex of mine who I dated back in 2016 messaged me again recently trying to initiate a conversation. This is so random since I’ve since deleted his number. I did ask who it was since it could’ve been job/appointment related and it ended up being him. I didn’t reply since I have no desire to talk to him (he cheated on me). I’ve also had another ex who messages me from time to time. 

As a girl, if I stop talking to a guy I’m permanently done if I feel as if the relationship cannot be rekindled. 
These are guys I’ve met from online dating and have gone out on one date with (we mutually agree it’s going nowhere) or some are actual ex bf’s. 

I don’t keep numbers of anyone (let alone ex’s) who I don’t talk to on a regular basis or message months/years later.

Does anyone do this and why?"
Tinder,I got a girls snap and I’m looking for a hookup. What should I say? What should I say to kind of figure out if she’s looking for a hookup and what direction should I lead the conversation?
Tinder,"Account Ban? So, when I opened the app this evening, I had to log in which I thought was odd. Maybe some TOS update I thought. Anyways, I logged back in w/ Google through my email address to be met with ""your account has been banned for violating terms of service"".

Is being undateable breaking the terms of service now? Seriously though, what gives? All my pictures are legit, SFW, verified, I've never harassed anyone in any way shape or form, or engaged in anything untoward...just absolutely puzzled, seeing as there's no explanation given. 

What do?"
Tinder,"What do girls like? I’m about to get back into the dating game, thinking about getting the dating apps, testing the waters out. I haven’t been in the dating game for like 10 years.. I’m not good with small talk,I’m more of a deeper meaning convo. How can i start conversations or keep them going at first? Ladies help your boy out please :)"
Tinder,"I hate it when a conversation is actually going really well... But they reply maybe 1-3 times a day. I mean, FULL essay-length replies that would suggest she’s into it, but then they barely reply. I get it, she’s either not *really* into it, or I’m guy #9 out of 22 and it isn’t my turn lol; just wanted to rant a little."
Tinder,"I got a girls snap from tinder and she’s nearby, what do I do next? Other conversations I’ve had have died out because I don’t know how to be entertaining when I’m just getting to know somebody. What should I talk about and what should I do to stop the convo from dying? I don’t understand things like this very well because the county I lived in before I moved here had really shitty people so I don’t have a normal idea of what’s generally expected. 

Also, she said she wants to meet good people on her tinder profile. What does that even mean?!"
Tinder,"“Subscribing” on snap? I matched with a girl on tinder and gave her my snap, and she sent me a friend request but when I look at her profile it says subscribe and her profile is different looking than everyone else’s. What’s this mean?"
Tinder,"In search for advice So, i am new to the dating scene, as i am out of my first relationship that lasted 5+ years and i am looking into dating currently. The problem for me is that i am looking for someone with a lot of kinky preferences in bed and have no idea how to actually find people with a similar to mine kinks. Any advice on how to actually find such people will be helpful. If it matters - i am in Eastern Europe, not in a big country."
Tinder,"Found the perfect girl for me on Tinder, now she’s my girlfriend! Thank you Tinder, hopefully I won’t have to download you again. I’m just so damn happy. It’s been fun tinder gang but I think it’s my time to go. Here’s to a cheers and to a good luck to all you love seekers out there! And cheers to all you who just want to fuck around. I’ve had my fair share of that on Tinder, but those days are long behind me. Just, thank you Tinder!"
Tinder,"Girl is giving mixed signals? So I matched with this girl, we hit it off pretty well and I got her snap. We are still talking and we talked about intimacy and she said she was down to make out and meet sometime. She finds me attractive and we got a bit in common. But I asked her if she would be down to hang this weekend and she was like, ""Hmmm. Maybe."" We just talked for like 4 or 5 days now. Should I give it another week before asking again, or is it possible that she's on the fence with me and other matches? Or she prolly needs to get to know me more? I understand it's tinder and it's hit or miss, and I do keep my options open, and I've have had some success from the app. Thank you for the feedback. 😎"
Tinder,Whats up with tinder? Created my account 2 says ago and got like 40 likes and 15 mayches the first few hours. Now two days later i get like 2- 4 likes a day. Is this normal?
Tinder,Does anyone else see a specific trait when they see their matches all lined up? I’ve always known that I’m attracted to dark hair and beards but I just looked at all my matches and they’re of course all dark haired and bearded but 90% of them are wearing hats in their default photos. I guess I’m into hats?
Tinder,"Cant verify my account I have been using tinder pretty consistently for about 2 years now and I’ve always tried to keep my account verified as I find it does help being people in but suddenly I’ve run into the problem where tinder won’t let me verify my pics. I’m doing the hand behind the ear pose and the lip pose as accurately as I can to both the reference image and my other images so the algorithm sees I’m the same person but when I hit submit it immediately gives me a “connection error” both with and without wifi on. Every time I hit retry it fails again. Is this a problem for anyone else? I’ve already tried deleting the app and reinstalling it, didn’t fix it"
Tinder,Am i the only one who does this? Am i the only one that matches with that one girl i wanted to match with and instantly deletes tinder? :|
Tinder,How to respond to compliments as a boy? Whenever the girl messages first with a compliment (particularly about appearance) I never know how to respond and keep the convo going. Any advice would be appreciated.
Tinder,"Should I not even bother with Tinder if I have bad anxiety? It's like, really stressful honestly. I accidentally superliked someone 5 minutes after making my account public and I wanna die lmao

I keep hiding and unhiding my profile. Should I just... not even bother? This is too stressful and I've only been on it for like 15 fucking minutes haha

But I mean, do you folks think it's worth pushing past the anxiety?

EDIT: YO IT WORKED OUT AND I SET UP A DATE OMG"
Tinder,"Failing to load matches. Help? Hi. My Tinder account is, like, shot. Suddenly. 

I'm a Gold member, and every time I try to match with someone who swiped right on me, it says ""error: failed to load"" and the match disappears into the internet ethers. 

The app has been INCREDIBLY slow for me lately, but this is as bad as it's ever been in terms of usability. It's straight up unusable. 

Anyone else experiencing this? I'm confident Tinder support is nonexistent."
Tinder,Conversation on why you use tinder? Do you actually use tinder in search for a potential “lover” or are you obsessed with validation and attention from random strangers (not me...) BE HONEST
Tinder,How many times do I verification? I must have done it four or five times now and I get the check mark every time but it just reloads again and makes me redo it. It’s the verification asking for the picture adding up to 14.
Tinder,18M fresh outa HS asking if tender is good How is tender is it pretty solid for finding genuine relationships? Around the 18-24 range ? If not what dating apps are good
Tinder,"Why are people on tinder usually so bad at communication? I understand the concept of not wanting to talk to someone anymore, or at all, and either stop responding or respond less frequently. However, what I don’t understand is when someone only responds with short replies, yet they continue to actively try to talk to you.

I will literally reply with sometimes long messages regarding topics of interests, only to get very short responses that I can’t even respond to. Yet, if I don’t reply, or just reply with a short response back, they will still message me back trying to carry on with a conversation they aren’t really contributing to.

Example:

Them: I love traveling.

Myself: That’s awesome, so do I. Where have you traveled to?

Them: Lot’s of places.

Myself: That’s cool. What are some of your favorites? I’ve been to money places in Europe and Oceania, have you been to anywhere in those parts of the world?

Them: Canada, Spain. Yes, I’ve been there.

Myself: Ok, nice (giving up).

The next day,

Them: Hey, how’s it going?

This happens so often. Like, I don’t get the lack of proper communication skills. Either talk, or don’t."
Tinder,"Tinder showing the same people over and over Title.

Doesn’t matter if I swipe right or left, the same people in the 50 mile radius I’m in are being shown over and over.

Also this is a fresh account."
Tinder,"Guys. What do you do when you notice a girl pretty much asks next to nothing about you? Everytime I talk about myself, it just seems forced. Like to me, it seems they're clearly just uninterested in me but they still talk. It's so weird"
Tinder,Need Advice Hey guys! 19M here. So I’m about to FaceTime this girl I met online soon. We’ve been talking for a week already but I’m worried about making a bad impression over the FaceTime. I’ve never really made it past this part before so any tips to make sure that she’ll still want to go on a date with me next week during Spring Break?
Tinder,Got super liked by a girl with no bio I just got superliked by a girl with no bio. Do I match with her and just wait for her to say something or say something stupid to turn her off. Aaah why do these women keep bio empty. Any suggestions?
Tinder,"Banned for no reason? So I checked my profile today and saw that I have been banned from the app. I didn’t do anything wrong. My profile is verified and I have Tinder Gold. Is anyone else having this experience? I figured it was a bug and a false flag or something because my profile is very clean. I’m so mad because I finally got a good match on the app after months of using it and now all my matches are gone😡.

I’m a woman. I would get 100+ likes a day and my profile had over 2000 likes in a short amount of time."
Tinder,"How to open when girl has no information on her profile?? Hey, I've been having terrible luck getting responses on Tinder, and all the advice I see says to be as specific as possible and tailor your comment to their profile... I just matched with this really cute girl, but her pictures don't really have any notable features and her bio is just a joke about being short... I can't think of anything funny to say about her being short, so I'm coming up blank... How's

""Hey &lt;name&gt;, you've got a cute smile, what makes it come out the most?""

That's the best I can come up with rn, but I'm not a big fan of it...

Thanks"
Tinder,"One Side Message Disappearing My friend and I matched on Tinder, because you know its funny.

However after a little while, she completely disappeared from my matches. I asked her if she had unmatched, or even deleted her account. She hadn't, took a look on her phone, and I still showed up as a match for her. Message history and everything, she sent another message through tinder, I recieved the notification, yet when I try to open it, nothing.

This seems to happen a fair bit, even some times newly matching with someone, them messaging me, and as I try to check the message, the entire match has disappeared. Has anyone else had this issue, or knows a sollution?"
Tinder,I see people here I see some people here posting as if tinder sucks do it is making an account worth it or is it just like meet me
Tinder,"We've extended your range... Hi, quick question. Is there anyway to turn off the setting where tinder automatically extends your search range and age criteria ""so the fun doesn't stop"". It usually comes up as a notification when there's nobody left in your criteria (even though there is).

It's annoying having to swipe past people outside my area to find those who actually are. I've already tried logging out and back in again.

Thanks!"
Tinder,"How do you prefer to meet people? I'm trying to get funding for a new dating app and would love if you all could answer this quick poll! Thank you so much!!!

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/m372i3)"
Tinder,"Out of the loop questions What the hell are crystals? 

Also when someone puts “Baking” as an interest do they mean smoking weed? Because there is a suspicious amount of bakers on this app."
Tinder,"Should tinder allow you to see who has viewed your profile, even if they left swiped? A lot of people worry that their accounts are not being shown to people in range of them. This makes dating apps really frustrating to use"
Tinder,"Why do some girls message you days later? I noticed girls usually never message me first right after we match or the day of.

When they do message me first it usually days after. Usually a week or two. I even had a girl message me recently and it was a month ago when we matched.

Why is this? It would be nice if they messaged me right away for a change."
Tinder,"Poll for women: Do you look at a man's profile for an indication of his resources? 

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/m2y9aq)"
Tinder,"lOCkDoWn BrOUghT ME heRE The two most annoying and popular things that I see in people's profiles are, ' I'm bored entertain me' and 'Lockdown brought me here'. For me, immediate swipe lefts. These type of people, imo, have 0 personality and probably are boring 😂😂"
Tinder,"Anyone else’s tinder been fucked for a while ? My age and range setting haven’t worked in a long time and now I’m constantly getting told I’m getting new likes when I’m not , super frustrating considering I pay for the app , is it just me or is tinder shit now"
Tinder,"What am I doing wrong ? Hi everyone, I probably hold the record now for lowest matches. I’ve been using app for 3 years, had 10-15 matches at most, which only 1 replied, then she decided to ghost again. I recently did this verification thing also. 
I know I’m not a good looking guy but even people my standards unmatched me."
Tinder,"Tinder regularly changing age and range settings? About once a day I get a notification that ""Tinder successfully changed your age and range settings for more endless fun"" (paraphrased but thats more or less what it's saying).
The weird thing is when I go in the app the settings are still the same but now it actually shows me people without my range instead of saying there is nobody left. How can I stop the app from doing this? Since it seems to ignore my settings. Even if I click on the notification it doesn't lead me to other setting or something it just opens the app."
Tinder,"Glitch or another explanation? I have platinum. I super liked a profile and an hour later she matched me. I was busy at the time and waited an hour or two to send an opening message. When I went to do that, the match was gone. I figured she looked or relooked at my profile and unmatched. Slight ego hit but whatever. 

Maybe an hour or two after that, I received a push notification to message my match and not keep her waiting. I clicked on the notification which took me to her profile and I sent a regular message. Despite this, she is not listed in my matches, neither immediately after I sent the message nor today. Glitch or is something else going on?"
Tinder,"Tinder on website Hello Reddit, I recently tried to make an account on the tinder website on my laptop. I received no likes at all in 24 hours, is this a problem at tinder"
Tinder,"To Tinder or not to Tinder Honest question/informal poll:Did Tinder help you right after ending a long-term relationship or may be it is better to take some time before getting exposed to potentially radioactive interactions?

Male, straight, 32y asking"
Tinder,"My likes are disappearing In the last 24 hours I've gone from 80 likes(can't see them, not matches) to 62 likes. I've had around the 80 for about 2 weeks but now they just vanishing. Any ideas why?"
Tinder,"Randomly unmatched. Not sure what to make of it? So I matched with a girl the other day. We had lots in common so had decent back and forth conversation for a few hours. As things were going well I asked if she fancied a call sometime as we can't meet under the current circumstances. She replied asking if we can keep texting for a bit as she's a bit of a nervous Nancy to which I said no worries. Then a minute later she's gone from my matches

I'm guessing it really is just nerves on her part. Maybe she's new to OLD and was just overwhelmed?"
Tinder,"I got a message from someone I never swiped right on And I know for a fact I never swiped right because their bio says ""no strings attached"" which I'm absolutely not looking for and never would've swiped right on. In fact, I don't think I actually ever came across their profile to begin with because I look at each one carefully before swiping. Yes I would remember if I'd seen them before, no I wasn't drunk, no I didn't accidentally swipe right, none of that. I don't drink or mass swipe right. I know I can just unmatch right away, which I did, but I'm worried that this happened because they hacked the app and can un-unmatch themselves and message me again. Does anyone have any explanation? There's a few posts about this happening to others but the most recent one is from two years ago and none of them got this question answered. Google was also useless."
Tinder,"Conversation disappeared? I was in the middle of a conversation with somebody, and then as they were typing suddenly the chats just disappeared, little tinder flame showed up and then I closed it and the chat disappeared. I imagine they unmatched with me, just seems odd as they were in the middle of typing. 

Any thoughts?"
Tinder,"Did I ever tell you about the guy with gum? So I met a guy on tinder. We went out, things were going great and went back to his place. We started making out, one thing let to the other and we were naked doing the deed... and then he Stops and says ""o shit, stay there.""  My natural response was to sit up and response with ""What happened?""  I then tried to run my hands through my hair and can't. In the heat of the moment, he opened his mouth and allowed his gum to drop in my hair.... he returned to me with ice,  peanut butter, and scissors and asked ""which one do you want?""  The moral here  is men can't fuck and chew gum!"
Tinder,"The “accidental” Super Liker For those that declare in bio “if I super liked you, it was (probably) by accident!” (tho it is easily done tbf, for a beginner anyway) — it’s kinda like admitting you’ve wet yourself… you just can’t deny the warm and fuzzy feeling the Super Like can provide!

It’s almost as bad as the coy womenfolk that declare “you have to message first if we match”."
Tinder,"wtf do i do now so like i use tinder almost as a joke and if something happens thats okay.  
so i used a cheesy pick up line very sexual and she was actually into it and basically said i was in.  
but like what do i do now, ask her number, her snap or just a date like shit what now"
Tinder,Checking Tinder Notifications Let’s say if I was to check my tinder after getting a notification would that affect my Elo score just by opening the app?
Tinder,"Disable daily notification for Special delivery recommended matches I receive a daily notification from Tinder for ""Special delivery"" saying there are 3 recommended matches ready for me. I cannot find a way to disable it, and my online searching cannot seem to find anyone that mentions this notification. Is everyone also getting it, and did anyone find a way to disable it?"
Tinder,"Anyone else instantly swipe left when someone says 'look at my 3rd pic' but it's in the wrong order? You know the one, when they turn on the 'suggested order' so it makes their tinder bio completely useless and their 'extra cool photo' is all the way at the end? And it's not even a cute dog?

Maybe I'm being picky. Hmm."
Tinder,"First Conversation I am male (21)  from India.
Can anyone tell me how to start first conversation with girls on tinder if u get a match.
Coz i think i'm really sucking at it.. 😕
All suggestions welcomed.... And it'll be a great help.
Thanku"
Tinder,"Link expired when sharing a profile Myself and a female friend occasionally send each other profiles of women we've matched with. But about half the time when sharing the link it will say Link Expired. 
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason when it doesn't work, even when we click the link immediately. 
Anyone know what the deal with this is?"
Tinder,"Question for the girls What’s your personally most preferred physical hair color on guys? Black, blonde, dirty blonde, dark brown, light brown, red, something on the rainbow, what? Lol"
Tinder,"Response times I've always wondered what are people's threshold for receiving a message back. What do you think is a reasonable timescale of trying to have a conversation with someone? Is it minutes, hours or even days? Do you not really care?  I'd love to hear it!"
Tinder,"How have your Tinder dates played out? I tried Tinder years ago and was gloriously unsuccessful in ever securing a date. Now I am already married with a child, so I doubt I will ever find the answer to this question myself.

How have your Tinder dates played out? Did you go straight to the bedroom or did you treat it as a true date?"
Tinder,"Does the super like after a like still work with Tinder Platinum? I bought Tinder Platinum a week ago and it has been great, getting more matches everyday in comparison to when I used normal Tinder (2 matches a week). 

There's a special tab on Tinder Platinum where you can see who you previously liked so you can super like them later, I'm used to getting matches from super likes, but using this feature I haven't gotten any yet, only from those super likes with messages embedded into them. 

Do they still work or is Tinder faulty in this regard? Has anyone had the same experience?"
Tinder,Weird Tinder glitch I started using a free Tinder boost and got a few Tinder likes according to my notifications. But when I go to 'likrs' there's nothing there. This has happened for a long time and it's frustrating. Wtf. Anyone else ever deal with this?
Tinder,"Would like the ladies opinions As a fairly witty 59M who is looking for a LTR I have never really thought about Tinder. Frankly given my demographic it scares the hell out of me ( &amp; I don’t scare easy😂). 

Ladies is it even worth it for me to try there or search elsewhere? Thanks in advance for any insight you can give!"
Tinder,Is it even worth it anymore? I’ve been on and off with the app and it’s always turned out to be a waste of time. Should we even bother with Tinder anymore?
Tinder,Last date was a sociopath. My last date on Tinder 3 years ago invented this whole other life that his family and I had no idea was a lie.  ow at 40 is Tinder even worth it?
Tinder,"Fed up! Tinder is shit! I’m [F38] and absolutely fed up of OLD. If I match with someone, I message them. I don’t wait for them to message me. 

I get lots of compliments but that’s it... nothing ever goes anywhere. It’s so frustrating. 

I’m not a game player. I don’t wait for hours before responding to someone’s message. 

I love reading the stories on here about people’s happy endings but in the meantime for a lot of us it’s soul destroying 🤦🏼‍♀️😑

Tell me it gets better 🤯🤯🤯"
Tinder,"Do men just click ""yes"" on everyone? I have just changed my settings, out of curiosity, to ""everyone"" and I have got 12 likes in a few hours (all men), and that is 12 more than I have had in literally months. I have had multiple accounts, some of them lasting over 2 years, and the most amount of likes combined on all those accounts over the past 5-6 yeara is less than 20... 

So what gives? Is it true that most men, regardless of sexual orientation, just click ""yes"" on everyone?

I don't do that, I personally say ""no"" to more women than I say ""yes"" to because 95% of the profiles are just women looking for hookups or very blatantly looking for validation and not looking for something serious 

Boobs out, arse pics, swimsuits, drinks in hand, duck face, filters on all photos... None of that is attractive and is just a huge turn off for me personally, it's just superficial."
Tinder,"31F getting matches but no responses As the post says, I am still actively getting matches but am not receiving responses to my messages. I have never had a problem with this. I am curious as to why I could be shadow banned (if this is the reason) as I have not used Tinder much in the past year (obvious reasons), am not a spammy profile re-creator, have a good bio and pics and am not ugly...so I don’t know what gives. Also my profile is verified. Statistically, some of my matches should be responding. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a sort of glitch where you can send but not receive messages? What the eff is going on? How am I matching with 20 dudes over the course of 1-2 weeks and NONE of them are responding? That’s just not feasible."
Tinder,What would you like added to tinder? If you could have any features and new ways of working things what would you add to tinder and why? What would you find helpful?
Tinder,"Tired of Tinder? Try Facebook Dating. I've gotten (literally) 20x as many matches FB dating is no joke.  You get unlimited likes and there are no paid promotion features whatsoever.  Just ""Like"" or ""Nope"" buttons.  I can't overestimate how much better of a dating app it is, it's embarrassing for Tinder to be so outclassed without even offering subscriptions.  Just try it, trust me."
Tinder,"Have I been shadow banned? I didnt use my account for probably over a month, and when i got back on it seems I've been shadowbanned. I paid for Gold, so i can see I have likes, but when i go to match with them, they disappeared completely. What is going on? Is there any recourse for this?"
Tinder,"Age Restricted A few years ago my account (my number) got Age restricted but I am 19 (turning 20) now and my account is still age restricted. 

Is that me done forever or is there a way I can restart everything with that number"
Tinder,"Photos become blurry/low quality I have good quality photos that look perfectly fine when uploaded to Instagram, but they look really blurry or low-resolution when uploaded to Tinder.

I tried cropping as a square, and also at 640x640 with a 50 kb file size. I also tried uploading from wifi, cellular, and desktop. The result is always the same. It's not like a minor issue either - the photos genuinely look terrible (especially a more close-up portrait type one). The people I swipe on seem to have photos that are looking a lot better. Is there anything else I can try to fix this?"
Tinder,"I superliked someone but the account doesn't show up on likes sent as the title says, i superliked someone and a few minutes later i checked the likes sent tab only to find their account not there. is this in any way just a glitch or is this something else?"
Tinder,"[Android] Anybody know if it's still possible to change your location with a Fake GPS app? **EDIT** I was able to spoof my location successfully in the browser version of tinder on my pc with firefox using [the technique described under the ""Manually change your location in Firefox"" header](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/change-location-chrome-firefox-spoof/). Where it says ""geo.wifi.uri"", that option was changed to ""geo.provider.network.url"".

I'm moving in a month and would like to start swiping in that area. I realize I could pay for passport, but I'm not going to do that and am only interested if there is a way to get a GPS spoofing app to work.

I tried installing Fake GPS, setting it as my mock GPS app in the developer options, force stopping Tinder, clearing Tinder cache, selecting new location in Fake GPS app.

When I open google maps, I get my faked location which is great, but when I open Tinder, it still shows my distance from matches as if I'm still in my true location. I also tried disabling my mobile data, but no change.

I also tried a VPN that I pay for, but that only seems to affect IP and not GPS location.

Wondering if anybody knows of a way to get it to work? I'd also be willing to use tinder on my PC's browser if there's a way to spoof location successfully with that.

Thanks!"
Tinder,"No likes I’m an 18 year old boy, I wouldn’t say I’m bad looking. I live in London so definitely isn’t about not having enough people around. I have around 60 matches in total, I use to get about 1 like a day which isn’t much but was something. For the last week I’ve been stuck on 8 likes. Haven’t received a single like or match for 8 days. Nothing changed in my profile, I’m still swiping on people most days. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks :)"
Tinder,"I have accepting the dehumanization of the dating process and am coping a lot better. It's like a job hunt process. I am not a fully fledged person with my own hopes and fears and desires. I am my height, my income, my body, and my capacity to entertain. I do not become more than this until I have earned the right.

An invested romantic partner may care, but no girl I'm going on a first, second, or even third date wants to hear about my issues, struggles, or less than attractive aspects of my personality. They want to be entertained, and only after I have provided sufficient entertainment do I earn the right to share genuine emotional intimacy.

To contrast, I didn't let the cutthroat and dehumanizing nature of job searching get me down. My ego didn't get bruised when a potential employer didn't call me back; I didn't go into a spiral of self-doubt. I didn't go looking for validation or emotional connection from a potential employer. I didn't double-text the HR rep of that one really cool company. I just opened up indeed.com and sent out more applications, I did adequate research on companies I applied to without seeming over-eager, I followed up at reasonable intervals, and during interviews I spent my mental energy on being astute and tactful rather than on self-doubt and anxiety.

I need to treat dating the same way. Your employer doesn't care about your issues until after they've already hired you and spent resources training you, so don't mention to them how your car is running rough and needs a transmission job during the interview!

**EDIT** (typo): accepted*"
Tinder,"My fiend sees other girls than me? Age, distance,location and everything is the same and we made an  acc at the same time ans he sees other girls than me? I tries to find some girls of his stack but they never showed up (in range)"
Tinder,"When is asking for a date too soon, too late? My thoughts when asking for a date (for a relationship, not a hookup):

1. Too early and you're too needy (red flag).
2. Too late and you risk turning the conversation into a pen pall scenario, or you say something (accidentally) that turns the other person off.

So, when do you think is a good time to ask?
Should I wait a few days?
Should I wait for 6 or 7 back and forth messages? (This could be over 1 or 2 days, to a whole week... ).

Thanks guys."
Tinder,"Guy liked my reply and then unmatched me. Huh? So I'm dipping my toes into online dating. I have been swiping a lot these days as I'm on sick leave so I have a lot of matches. Due to that, coupled with the fact that no profile so far has excited me, I never message first. I do try to respond, though.

Well, after finally matching with ONE guy I liked, I decided to take the initiative and messaging him a few hours after matching (I waited first if he's initiate the convo). I wrote something about his bio/cats as he mentioned them in his bio and he even had photos with his cat. He responded later in the day when I was already in bed, giving me a throughout response and then in return asking about something in my profile. In the early morning I responded to both things. Then at night (same time as yesterday) he liked (hearted) my second response and then unmatched me. ?

I'm confused. I'm trying not to take it personally, as he's a complete stranger, but I don't really understand (and I AM a little bummed considering the first time I take the initiative THIS is what hapoens!). Why even bother responding (and elaborately at that) and then unmatch after getting another response? I don't think I wrote anything special that warranted that ... Is it better to wait a longer time after matching before messaging, does it come across desperate/weird if a woman does that or what? Actually, I don't think I'm likely to message a guy first again, tbh!"
Tinder,"Is it sad I’ve only had one S/O for 2.5 years of dating apps? Got one s/o like 2 years ago only for a couple months, since then nothing has worked out past 2 dates"
Tinder,"ban I got banned a while ago but I could make an account again.

I downloaded bluestacks, loaded tinder app and connected it with my google account and it works again."
Tinder,"Condoms or raw on most of your hookups?

Tinder,Improvements? What do you think would be some productive additions for Tinder to make for their app? Personally I think more advanced filter options for swiping like being able to set it with platinum so only verified profiles show up in swiping for starters would be a great idea.
Tinder,"Do girls actually get satisfaction from matching with a bunch of guys? I am pretty new to tinder but I see a lot of bios saying ""only here for a ego boost"" or something of that nature.

I asked some of my female friends why they downloaded tinder and they told me its makes them feel good matching with a bunch of guys. But they actually had no intention with meeting with any of them.

When I asked my guy friends how they use tinder apparently they just swipe right on everyone and that I should do the same.

So I decided to make a account as a girl and put a picture of a coconut and ended up with 99+ likes within minutes. Within a hour every swipe was basically a match. This makes me think that most guys are doing the same as well.

How does any girl get self gratification when it just seems like guys are swiping right on anything apparently?"
Tinder,"For the Love of GOD Have a Personality Just a microvent because this is all that I get in my area, but holy mother of GOD ladies, have a personality in your bio. I promise you it's really not hard or frightening. Your snap or ig is NOT a personality trait, nor is the office or requesting pickup lines 😂"
Tinder,"Other options apart from tinder Hi, I've been using tinder for a while now and I don't seem to be getting any matches, (I'm not the best looking guy out there and I'm a bit big for my size, im 6'5"" and weight about 245lb.). I don't really want to change my pictures to like pictures of me dressed up or anything like that because I basically don't ever do that and I don't want to not be myself, (though I do admit not all of my pictures are great quality as is). But, to the question, is there an app that would better fit me outside tinder or am I out luck in that regard? 

My profile for reference: https://tinder.com/@wes42

TL:DR, is there a better dating app for people that aren't super good looking?"
Tinder,Help I'm new Hello here I'm new to tinder I've just downloaded the app and already got some likes would it be wise to upgrade to tinder gold or would that be stupid?
Tinder,Banned from tinder for the first time I’m so upset 😭 I finally made a new tinder account after deleting a few months ago. Started with fresh pictures and a simple bio. I even got tinder gold so i could easily see who liked me. After 9 days I got banned out of nowhere!! I didn’t even have 100 matches since I was trying to be more selective and have better luck this time. The only thing I can think of is a few matches I ended up not replying to that may have reported me. Just a vent !!
Tinder,"I quit tinder 8 months ago,felt much better and 5 months later met a girl in the park. I'v been on tinder for couple of last years, and I'm glad one day I woked up and said thats it. It makes you depressed, lonely and you start to think if I can't get girls on the internet how can I get them out there. I never liked online dating, at first it was awesome, because I thought it would be fun and you would get a chance at least from 1 girl out of 20. Boy was i wrong.

I think I am a handsome guy , but way to slim or skinny compared to other guys and that's why I kept on online dating. 

Actually now I have a 9/10 girl who I met outside. So fuck this app. 🙂"
Tinder,"“I sWiPeD RiGhT fOr YoUr PeT.” A good response to that is: “Well sweetheart, I swiped right for your tits.” 

Hate me if you want, I’m just so damn tired of seeing that on tinder"
Tinder,"What’s the mean amount of matches per week? For a guy. I’ve gotten 38 matches over the past two weeks on this app, and I was wondering what the mean amount of matches are for this app.

On apps like Hinge where I can change my location to NYC (where I normally live), I got 19 matches just today. For Tinder, I live in a very small southern town with my family and the pickings for an Indian guy in a town that’s 90% white aren’t very ample.

What would you say is the mean amount of matches per week for a guy? I’m sitting on 19 per week at this rate, and idk what that number means without a comparable.

Thanks!"
Tinder,"Calling guys who are doing well on Tinder! Care to share profile pics and bio? After getting basically zero matches with girls I find even remotely attractive, I guess I have to re-consider a lot of things lmao. This has been hard. 

I knew Tinder was difficult and superficial beforehand, but thought I was a decently good looking guy and would have a shot with 6-7/10 girls at least, though I don't have the very best pics, I thought I had some decent ones. 

Anyway I'm just curious about what it takes.

I've been talking to some girls I know IRL and when the topic of Tinder comes up, I've told them how unsuccesful I am and they act really surprised. Maybe they're just being nice or maybe they don't realize how selective most girls can afford to be on Tinder."
Tinder,"Am I doing dating wrong? So I'm curious if anyone has been in the same situations as me or if anyone has any advice haha
Now it's hard enough to get anyone to actually talk to me on tinder let alone get a date (26 m) I manage to get a date maybe once every 4-6 months

So far we go on our first date and she usually seems like she's had a good time, we both laugh heaps and learn a lot about each other, then after the date when I get home I usually send them a message, something along the lines of ""it was nice meeting you, I had a great time getting to know you 😊""
And so far in the last 6 years only one has actually replied to me, just ghosted. 

But here's the kicker, I had a date last weekend and it has left me more confused than I have ever been. I went on a date with this girl who seemed more interested in me than I've ever had during the week leading up to our date on Saturday, I had a great time and overall was a really amazing date, now when we were saying bye she made out with me a little (good sign right?), then we parted ways, again got home and sent her a message. Bam, ghosted. Like huh? I must've been a terrible kisser 😂"
Tinder,"Re-matching When you guys need to re-match with someone because something happened and you lost your account/matches or whatever else might have happened, how did you go about re-matching? Just make a new account and keep swiping?

Thanks"
Tinder,"People, stop adding me to make me listen to your original music Sometimes they genuinely have good music but some people take it too far. 

One time I got invited to this girls concert thinking it would be a date afterwords. NO, I was stuck in a room with all of her family and friends on the first day who were definitely judging the poop out of me until the concert was over. Then she left me in the dark part of NYC in the middle of the night to go clubbing with her friends (never invited)

Music is important to you yes, but don’t manipulate people into listening to it"
Tinder,Why are people who like me disappearing? I have tinder gold but just recently I’ve noticed that girls who have sent me likes from a long time ago are now disappearing left and right. Do likes sent to you expire over time? I lose about 10-15 likes a day.
Tinder,"Where is the right place to report a stolen Identity/Photos, Womens pictures used to scam users...? Classical one...
Nice blonde, almost perfect 10, sadly can not video call whatsapp because in a country where this isn't  working...., having a sweet set of photos, telling you she is born and raised in the US but her english is so bad,... and, of course, will be soon back again in your hometown for business, and need (financial) help.---what else.

Now I am asking, I want to know, if there is a way to warn the girl on the pictures, that 99.9% likely are used without her permission/without her knowing...

Ideas?"
Tinder,"FUCK Tinder's customer support Tinder actually has the worst fucking customer support I've ever seen in my 25 years of living.

The automated responses with absolutely NO way of talking to a human is absolute garbage and shouldn't be fucking allowed. I can't think of any other service that is as bad on this as Tinder, and it fills me with a seething fucking rage that it doesn't have a formal appeal process for banned accounts. I bought tinder gold yesterday and got banned today for no reason like so many others on here.

What the fuck do they do at Tinder headquarters all day? What's stopping them from having a normal customer support like literally every other company?

Fucking garbage and lazy as shit company."
Tinder,"I am the master of getting unmatched Every girl I have matched with has unmatched me with in the first 3 messages 

I do not send disturbed messages or anything like that 

I normally ask them about what they do for fun and try and have a conversation about that. It is normally after I replay back to the message of what they like to do for fun that they unmatch me.

That is if I get a reply lol"
Tinder,"If you have a macro program, write one that taps ""Space"" every 500 ms. Tinder becomes 50x more useful. If you have a macro program, write one that taps ""Space"" every 500 ms.  Tinder becomes 50x more useful.

Because instead of hitting extra buttons, you're just hitting left or right arrows.  You become so efficient you get 5x as many profiles viewed over time, and 10x the quality of perusing every pic."
Tinder,"Question for all the females on tinder Okay so very short back story, I used to be pretty fat (89kg) and well now I’m not and I’ve recently gotten pretty dang fit (70kg and pretty much shredded) and extremely proud of it. 

My question is though, if you see someone who obviously works out and shows off their physique with one of their tinder photos, what’s your immediate reaction? Do you hate it, like it or have no opinion on it?"
Tinder,"Discussion on profiles out of your league So what do people do when they see a profile of someone that is hotter/more attractive than themselves? I personally unlike the profile to not waste a like, but i want to hear what others think."
Tinder,"Profile advice (23m) is tinder gold worth a shot? https://tinder.com/@jackm1997

Back on this recently but after a few days tinder has been suggesting girls under my age range mostly and way beyond my distance. Also have 11 likes waiting but so far no luck. Any chance tinder gold is worth a shot?"
Tinder,"Tinder changing my preferences As title, Tinder keeps changing my age and location range **SO THE FUN DOESN’T END**

Firstly that’s a joke because Tinder isn’t much fun for a guy with few matches but secondly I’m closer to 30 than I am 25 so no, *I do not want to see all these 18-21 year olds 50miles outside my preferred area*

Is there any way to stop this? If not, time to delete, it’s enough of a time sink anyway without having to spend time swiping off people I’m very clearly not interested in"
Tinder,"Losing hope with this I keep running out of people to swipe on, with no matches. I reinstall the app to get people to swipe on again but the same thing happens. I'm not bad looking and there's no long winded or weird stuff in my bio... But it seems like as soon as I re-appear in women's feeds they just swipe left again."
Tinder,"Is tinder rly that bad? I got tinder for one week . I had 6 Matches during my first 2 days thanks too the newby bonus. After that only one once in a while.
I mean yes most of the matches were boring but i think that would be the same when i meet a stranger i dont know.
Only 2 didnt even react the rest always wrote back and asked questions.
I am in this sup for a few months and still dont understand the negative attitude. I mean yes its unfair for guys but its not thaaat bad. Why do i got the feeling that this sup is 80 incels who are just mad that not everybody wants to date a 30 year old wizard."
Tinder,"Tinder Subscription Is there any way to take out a Tinder subscription other than by credit card, where the transaction can be viewed on a statement?  I used to pay with Google play but that's no longer possible.  

Its a damn nuisance."
Tinder,"Does swiping left take an emotional toll on anybody else? I'm new to the whole Tinder scene and feel bad every time I reject someone's profile....like, you're beautiful in your own way but I don't want to give you the wrong impression by swiping right in order to tell you that. I dunno; guess I'm just gonna wait 'til this pandemic situation has boiled down and then hit up the bars like I'm 21 again."
Tinder,"Does this sound like a R$&amp;@ist? I told a guy the feeling of wanting sex is not mutual. He said “ that’s so conventional” and then he replied “ I have enough feeling to make up for both of us, I wouldn’t be asking if I didn’t really need it “. I think that just seems completely disgusting to me when I’m clearly saying I’m not into and the dude is saying crap like that thinking it’ll make me want to meet up.I think it’s time to block him. Am I in the wrong , I’ve never heard someone say he rather the other person not mutually want it. Yuck just yuck

This is the first disgusting experience I’ve on tinder by far"
Tinder,Will your profile appear for someone else if your discovery preferences do not include their profile? Example: Let's say I'm 30 and only want to look for people age 30+. Would a person who is 25 see my profile come up when swiping around? Or would I not appear for them because I myself am only looking for 30+ and therefore Tinder doesn't show pointless profiles that are impossible to match with another?
