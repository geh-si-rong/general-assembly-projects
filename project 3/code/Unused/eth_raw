# Note on NFT Art Posts

There's been a **ton** of excitement around NFTs on Ethereum lately. NFT stands for ""Non-Fungible Token"" - aka a digital object with provenance (who owned it when), and markets built into it, all enabled by the Ethereum blockchain. While the concept has been around for a few years, they've really started taking off in USD terms and public awareness. Learn more about NFTs here:  


* [The Non-Fungible Token Bible](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) (by OpenSea) 
* [Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT): Beginner's Guide](https://decrypt.co/resources/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-explained-guide-learn-blockchain) (Decrypt Media)  


While we are very happy to see artists exploring new forms of ownership and patronage, the r/ethereum frontpage has become very full of artists sharing their work. Therefore, we've decided to start removing NFT art posts in order to keep r/ethereum as a tech and protocol focused space. Discussion on NFTs and their place in the Ethereum economy, or news from NFT companies, will still be permitted. A few places you can check out to post your work:  


* r/NFT is a great place to share your work and connect with other creators
* many of the NFT marketplaces have lively community discords ([Zora](https://discord.com/invite/Va58aMrcwk), [OpenSea](https://discord.gg/qXYcsp663u), [Nifty Gateway](https://discord.com/invite/vjFVZTx), many others)

ethereum,"Being on crypto, do you also feel like you are living in alternative reality? I don't know if I'm alone on that but sometimes I am so deep in crypto, reading about new projects, such disruptive ideas, talking to great minds, seeing huge profits, etc, that it feels like I am in another reality.

It could also be a result of too much time on computer or books related to that, but when I go outside it looks like I am transported back to past 10 years. I know it is important to care of mental health, to balance things, although crazy things on crypto generates just a rush feeling that seems like if I stay off I'd miss the next revolutionary thing.

Well, just a thought that I wanted to share and discuss with other people on that field."

ethereum,I just invested my first 1000$...what now ? So for about a month now I have been debating on purchasing some ethereum and I finally pulled the trigger out of the blue and right after I did it I got goosebumps...now what ?
ethereum,"Last will in ETH? Hey, 
I've been wondering whether ETH can provide the function of a last will in sort of a smart contract or similar... I also crossposted this over at /r/cryptocurrency but moons take most of the attention, I guess. :)

Anyway.

In case of my death I have to leave some important passwords to others and like to have them stored safely under my control until then.

I'd like to give the other parties access to an encrypted file which contains the passwords / important documents. The password to the encrypted file would only be released from the smart contract if my interaction with it does not happen for a set amount of time.
30, 60, days -  any amount of reasonable time.

As long as I am alive I'd also have to sign the smart contract to continuously deny access to the content.

In short:  a ""if not signed / dead man switch"" rule must be obtained to grant access.


How do I achieve this and which project does provide such a functionality?
ETH maybe?


Do you think ETH is stable enough to exist in the unforseen future and is reliable enough today in terms of security?


I'd love to hear your ideas.
Sorry, I am not a native speaker. :) Thank you!"
ethereum,"Gas fee question. So I have 1.1... UMA token. Roughly $29. It wants $20 in eth gas to send it anywhere. 

Now I can adjust the gas fees and was wondering the likelyhood the token gets stuck or something else should I pay say, $4 in gas to send it? (Using exodus)

ethereum,Buying ETH through Trezor Is buying ETH through Trezor‚Äôs system a good idea? Anyone have any experience with this? Safe and reliable?
ethereum,Can someone please help me out here? I have like 3-4 transactions in Que or Pending in MetaMask and I cant do anything with them I've looked up videos on what to do and i've tried to update the nonce with more gas (even though i've set it to fast gas option everytime.) And I cant do it because of the fact that [Etherscan.IO](https://Etherscan.IO) doesn't show that theres a transaction yet. But nothing is going through. Will I lose all of the ETH in this wallet due to this? Like since theres not very much ETH in the wallet will I lose whatever is in there after the gas comes out for the next transaction to ATTEMPT to be processed? I'm so tired of these high gas fee's and slow transactions its getting so frustrating... EDIT: I figured out how to get the NONCE number and have sent a transaction to the same wallet address with an updated GAS fee of 116 GWEI and like 55K gas limit and its still not going through I do also have one REPLACED transaction that has been pending for like 20 hours now that might be causing this but as I already REPLACED the previous transaction then that one should be NULL right ? What a freaking nightmare just to buy some NFTs...
ethereum,"Crypto Wallets: which one is right for you Wait, can‚Äôt I just leave my crypto on the exchange I purchased them on? Well, that depends on a few factors, but let us start from the beginning. 

**What**

Your crypto wallet is what you use to interact with a blockchain network and falls under one of three categories: a paper, software or hardware wallet.

Now, there are different use cases, but the tl;dr is hardware wallets are the most secure method of storing your crypto, with software being the most convenient and paper wallets being widely considered obsolete/unreliable. 

**How**

The first thing to understand about wallets is that they don‚Äôt actually store your crypto. They are merely vessels through which you can interact with a blockchain allowing you to send and receive the required information in order to perform transactions on said blockchain. 

Examples of this information include:

1. Your public keys
2. Your private keys. Never share this with anyone as it will mean they are able to access your crypto. Also remember, if you don‚Äôt own the private keys, you don‚Äôt own the crypto. Looking at you, Robinhood! Your private keys (or seed phrase) will also allow you to access your crypto on any device and that‚Äôs because your crypto never actually leave the blockchain, they just change from one address to another.
3. An assigned address that you will use to receive or send crypto to and from your wallet, which acts as a location on the blockchain. It‚Äôs okay if your address is public. When sending or receiving crypto, always ensure you are sending crypto to the right address.

**Hot vs Cold** 

Hot wallets are any wallets that are connected to the internet. Your crypto is very accessible and trading with your crypto is convenient.

Cold wallets have no connection to the internet making them less likely to be compromised by those evil people who want your precious crypto. Cold wallets usually come in the form of a USB drive device that stores a user‚Äôs private keys securely. If you‚Äôre a loooooooong-term HODLer, this may be the option for you.

A cold wallet is a physical device that uses a random number generator (RNG) to create public and private keys. The device, which is not connected to the internet, is home to these keys, making it a cold wallet and as a result arguably the most secure methods to store your crypto.

**Software wallets**

**Web wallets**

Web wallets make it possible to access your crypto, without having to install software - think metamask (browser) and your exchange wallet. You create a password to access your crypto, but in some cases, the provider will hold the private keys. Again, if you don‚Äôt own the private keys, you don‚Äôt own the crypto. If you‚Äôre leaving your crypto on the exchanges, set up multi-factor authentication,¬†anti-phishing code, and¬†withdrawal address management.

**Desktop wallets**

If you opt for a desktop wallet, you will be installing software onto your computer and you‚Äôll be able to manage your crypto through that. You will have your private keys, which are stored locally on your computer. Encrypt it with a password as an extra precaution. BACKUP YOUR PRIVATE KEYS AND PASSWORDS because by doing so, you will be able to access your crypto on another device. Scan your computer regularly for viruses, malware etc.

**Mobile wallets**

These are very similar to desktop wallets but operate on‚Ä¶you guessed it, mobile devices making it incredibly convenient to send, receive and spend your crypto on the go. Again, BACKUP YOUR PRIVATE KEYS AND PASSWORDS.

Paper wallets are exactly that - pieces of paper with a crypto address and its public and private keys printed on it in the form of a QR code. A major flaw to this option though is that you are only able to transfer the entire balance to an address, making it the wrong option when wanted to send a smaller amount to an exchange to trade or to another address to purchase something. As stated above, this method is somewhat dated and is considered dangerous. 

**Finally, BACK UP YOUR SEED PHRASE AND PASSWORDS!**"
ethereum,"Can web3 be installed globally? I am getting ready to install the current version of web3 on a machine with CentOS v.7.8, 64 bit, and npm 6.14.11.

In the past, the web3 installation had some problems. Are there any issues with using the following command to install the current version of web3? **npm install -g web3**

1. Can I install web3 globally, so it will work with all domains on my server?
2. Do I need to make any directory current before typing ""npm install -g web3""?
3. Does the default web3 installation include the features of ethereumjs-tx.js, or do I have to install something else?

Thanks!"
ethereum,"gas price and gas limit question pardon me, I am new to eth. I gathered up some ethereum and now I am trying to move it to one place about $160. So I have two things on MEW wallet: transaction fee 169.00 Gwei and Gas limit set to 21,000. This costs me $6.6. I am wondering is it possible to lower it? I don't mind waiting for few hours/days.

ethereum,"ETH Staking I very interested in ETH staking. Right now I am on the fence and am seeking out any advice, tips, lessons with staking ETH. I partially understand the risk involved but if someone with first hand experience can give me their two cents I would appreciate it. GLHF"
ethereum,"Sending ETH I have a quick question I got a small amount of ETH on an exchange and would love to send it to my wallet but it's around 5$ fees I guess?

Is this because of the high gas fees atm? Should I wait or still send it?"
ethereum,"Simple Ethereum implementation? Hey folks. I'm a software engineer with a good working knowledge of modern cryptography.

I'd like to know more about Ethereum from a technical point of view. My question is: is there a ""simple"" Ethereum implementation that I can execute and work with from A-to-Z that shows the ""basics"" of Ethereum (not ""how to build a smart contract"", but Ethereum VM itself).

ethereum,"Is this idea possible to create with a smart contract? Here's the context. So suppose I have a wallet on a platform that has 10ETH in it. Let's call it Wallet A. I want to send that 10ETH from Wallet A to Wallet B, but during the course of sending to Wallet B, I would like 20% of the sent Eth to be redirected to another Wallet, call it Wallet C. 

Is it possible to use a smart contract to do something like this? Or would I need to send the 10 Eth to Wallet B, then once it is in Wallet B I would have to send the 20% to Wallet C?"
ethereum,"What does it take to 51% a PoS chain? Hey, we're all familiar with ""control 51% of the hashing power of a PoW chain = double spending/etc attack"". But what about PoS?

As I understand it, you still need to control 51% of the validators, but you have to stake each one at (currently, 32) some fixed ETH amount. But this doesn't mean that you need to control 51% of ETH, right? Just enough ETH for staking so that you can run 51% of the nodes?

Obviously this is much, much riskier than the PoW attack from an attacker's standpoint, but I want to clearly understand the technicals here. 

Additionally, some of the reading I've done suggests that the mitigation procedures for after a 51% attack takes place are different for PoW vs PoS chains, and I'd love to understand better."

ethereum,"Making the ecosystem more light-client friendly One of the challenges of the current Ethereum ecosystem is that while the protocol is theoretically light client friendly, and [light clients even exist and can be used today](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/run-light-node-geth/), they're not nearly as commonplace as was originally envisioned. Particularly, all of the following environments _could have been_ secured by light clients, but are instead typically secured by APIs connected to centralized services:

1. Mobile phone clients/wallets, even those where the key management is trustless (Status, Argent, Loopring, etc etc)
2. In-browser wallets (Metamask et al)
3. Other blockchains

There are two main problems:

1. The Ethereum light client verification protocol _is not light enough_.
2. There's not enough incentive to _serve_ light clients, leading to weakened performance.

We can think of each of these two problems as being tied to a corresponding one of the two key parts of a light client protocol. The first part is to download and authenticate the **header chain**, giving you Merkle roots to transactions and history and state; this is the part that is stymied by the Ethereum light verification protocol's heaviness. The second part is, given the Merkle roots, to get Merkle branches for any data you want to learn so that you can authenticate the data.

### Light client verification of headers

(1) is a big deal. For a light client to stay synced with the eth-PoW network today, they need to sync the eth-PoW _header chain_, which is about 600 bytes per 13 seconds: trivial for a phone or browser app, but already getting expensive for the light-client-inside-a-blockchain use case. And in all three cases, it precludes the user-experience gain of instant syncing after a long time offline. Even worse, the PoW algorithm (ethash) takes a long time to verify. Despite being explicitly designed for light client friendliness with its ""cache"" mechanism, cache-based verification still takes a significant amount of time.

The beacon chain has some upgrades in store, coming in the [first hard fork](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/HF1_proposal), that allow light clients to stay synced with the beacon chain much more efficiently: a mere ~10 kB per day should suffice for basic connectivity. Verification will be significantly more computationally efficient than ethash.

Note that even before the merge, a light client of the beacon chain can double as a light client of the eth-PoW chain: the beacon chain contains a hash of an eth-PoW block about 10 hours old, and so a client could choose to use the beacon chain to sync up to that point and then download eth-PoW headers from there. This would not be nearly as efficient as pure beacon chain verification after the merge, but it would still be a considerable gain.

### Merkle branches

The problem with Merkle branches is simple. There are _a lot_ of potential light clients, and each light client wants to learn _a lot_ of information about the history and state, and it's expensive to send all that information and generate Merkle proofs for it. The problem is worse because there's no incentive to help send information, so relatively few nodes are doing it.

There are two main kinds of solutions to this problem:

1. Create a channel-payment protocol where nodes can get paid for supplying proofs.
2. Reorganize the p2p network to make providing proofs simpler and cheaper; see [Piper Merriam's work on this](https://github.com/ethereum/stateless-ethereum-specs).

But either path will take some time to get right, and there's a lot of work to be done (realistically there's a good chance we'll need to do both).

### A short term path

But we should not despair from the complexity of a fully functional light client network. **Even if all we can do is have a trustless header chain verifier, and we can't make a reliable and decentralized protocol to fetch Merkle branches, this by itself can greatly increase the security guarantees of mobile phone and in-browser clients**.

This is because instead of asking a server to provide responses to queries and trusting those responses, a wallet can now maintain the header chain locally, ask the server to provide responses along with Merkle proofs proving that the responses are correct, and verify the Merkle proofs. **This is an intermediate mode that would be nice to move the Ethereum ecosystem over to soon**. In the longer run, we can work harder on making a more fully decentralized light client ecosystem."

If you're a light client (SPV), I understand how in the regular Merkle Tree scenario in bitcoin you simply concatenate the hashes and rehashing them upward in the path toward the root USING with the Merkle Proof provided by the full node. But how is this done in Ethereum? Cause from what I understand about the Merkle Patricie Trie, it's different from the Merkle Tree in that you can't verify construct/calculate it by concatenating hashes and rehashing them. What exactly is the process used here to calculate the hashes upward eventually leading to the calculation of the root hash?"

ethereum,"Best way to learn about decentralized apps, without getting overwhelmed I am interested in decentralized applications (much more than currency use case). It seems like Etherum is the platform for that. However even as some with a tech background (10 years of coding), everything is extremely confusing to me.   I will ask some questions and hopefully you guys have some guidance, thank you.   


1.) Is there any overall video or high level guide available on the state of the Etherunm user space.    


2.) With NFTS I see things like based on ERCXXX standard. What does this mean, are the different standards compatible.    


3.) When a company creates a coin on top of etherum. What does that mean, are they always easily transferable to other ETH based coins?   


4.) Is it possible to run arbitrary decentralized APIs on etherum. For example, say I wrote a web API in NodeJS. Could I somehow host it on the [ethereum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/) network, and route user requests against it."

Well of course we have many options, some being:

-Hold on to your loot!

-Find an online business that offers goods for crypto 

-Buy and sell your coin on an exchange 

These are all fantastic options and widely used by many. What was that you asked? Oh you want to trade your digital dollar for some fiat? Of course you do, you need to pay off that rig right? Right.

Well this is the question that has me wondering as well. How do you trade your ETH for fiat dollars? Can it be done anonymously? Who offers this service? Are there preferred ‚Äúvendors‚Äù or options? How is this being done? The bottom line is, how do you cash your ETH in for fiat dollars with emphasis on anonymity?

Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I find this to be a slightly overlooked topic when it comes to searching for the right answers on the web.  Which brings me to this wonderful community with never ending buckets of knowledge. Will you folks point me in the right direction? Maybe a few tips and tricks?

Link here for GitHub page: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md

The page called this out at the end that got me thinking about the potential for ETH to be deflationary in the long run:

ETH Burn Precludes Fixed Supply

By burning the base fee, we can no longer guarantee a fixed token supply. This could result in economic instability as the long term supply of ETH will no longer be constant over time. While a valid concern, it is difficult to quantify how much of an impact this will have. If more is burned on base fee than is generated in mining rewards then ETH will be deflationary and if more is generated in mining rewards than is burned then ETH will be inflationary. Since we cannot control user demand for block space, we cannot assert at the moment whether ETH will end up inflationary or deflationary, so this change causes the core developers to lose some control over Ethereum's long term monetary policy.

ethereum,"Smart-contract creator corruption and DAO control Hi there !

The following question is based on my understanding of the smart-contracts operation, maybe I'm wrong and I would be happy to be corrected.

So, I was wondering, if you want to be sure that the code deployed on the network is controlled by the DAO and not the creator of the smart-contract (to avoid contract creator corruption), but still upgradable, is there any way to achieve this ? What I mean by creator corruption is creator key stealing or purposely greedy creator that would upgrade the code to a version that would hurt the users.

Let's imagine that one developer wants to add a feature and proposes its upgraded version to the DAO. A vote would then proceeds to deploy this new contract, would that be feasible ? The compiled version could be authentified by comparing hashed version with everyone being able to compile the code and compare hashes for the proposed contract.

But then, would even the DAO be free from its creator if he had the private key to the address and wanted to modify the code ?

Maybe those questions are trivial and already answered but I was wondering if there was something I did not understand (like the creator's control over the smart contract) or if this was  already discussed.

Thank you lads !

Edit 2 : I found an answer which, I think, can be derivated to upgrade code on DAO approval : https://link.medium.com/qUD0IXLiseb

ethereum,"NFT -- Lets have a serious talk, a lot of you don't seem to understand what they are. A lot of people are treating NFT like they ARE the asset they represent instead of what they really are and have been since the crypto punk days when they were first conceived on the Etherum network. This is a fundamentally wrong way of using them.

Yes, you could theoretically store an image or a small bit of text in the meta of an NFT, but you're going to pay massive amounts of money just to put it on the chain. Back when ETH was around $500/eth we're talking $2k per mb, so now... with gas prices what they are and ETH @ $1.6k... shittt..... you could be looking upwards of $10k for 1mb.

In reality most the time the NFT stores simple meta data and points TO someplace that the actual asset is stored. So these complex concepts you guys are trying to place on them needs to be reeled in. NFT at their core are titles, like you'd have for a car or home. They define some information about the object, but are NOT the object. You also need to realize that without a legally backed construct such as a trust which recognizes the NFT, you can not legally sell a real world titled asset using an NFT. Nor are untitled assets (drawings, pencils, brushes, etc) ownership recognized by possession of an NFT, legaly.

Yes there are a few examples of when NFT can BE the assets, but that's mostly in the ticket space where an NFT can be a 1:1 representation of a ticket. This space still has flaws though, because you either have to trade the NFT out of your wallet or trade eth out of your wallet to confirm you own the wallet the ticket exists in (and thus exercise the purpose of the ticket). So you end up paying whatever gas fees are at the moment to exercise your ticket, which makes the whole experience effectively worse than alternatives.

If people don't get a grip on what NFT are and this 6million dollars for ""ownership"" of part of a YouTube video don't stop, we're going to have some SERIOUS overcorrection by governments in regards to them defining what OWNERSHIP is.

ethereum,"How does cross-project composability work for the upcoming L2 scaling solutions? I'm seeing a lot of hype right now as L2 feels like it's actually turning into reality but one area that I don't have a clear understanding of is how composability will work in this new L2-enabled landscape.   Will we have a whole host of project specific L2 silos and we will incur L1 gas fees (and potentially long time delays, depending on particulars of L2) moving between them?

Consider a possible defi use-case and let's imagine for this scenario that each project has managed to implement its own L2:

1. Deposit ETH into MakerDAO via DefiSaver, incur L1 TX fees in, but once you are in there, fees are cheap.  Can engage with DefiSaver automation tools on the cheap as well (yay!).
2. Take a loan against your ETH collateral, incur L1 fees and potential time delay to get your DAI out of there.
3. Take this DAI now sitting in your wallet and transfer to Uniswap, incur L1 fees to get in but once you are in fees are cheap.   Swap tokens as you please, all fees here are cheap.   Provide liquidity in Uniswap pools, also cheap since you are in Uniswap L2 silo.
4. Transfer Uniswap LP tokens out of Uniswap L2, incur L1 fees and potential time delay.
5. Take these LP tokens and transfer them to some other yield farming project where you can stake these LP tokens for further yield.  Incur L1 fees to get into this other silo.
6. etc etc.

Am I misunderstanding how this is going to work?   I still see a lot of L1 fees/transactions here.  What am I missing about these magical L2 solutions?  What if the market takes a downswing and I find myself wanting to move assets back into MakerDAO to reduce my C-ratio?   Am I at the mercy of potentially slow L2 exit times or relying on some 3rd party service to advance me an equivalent amount within the desired L2 for a service fee?"

ethereum,"NFTs and The Creator Economy: The new ""port of entry"" for all internet media In his essay ‚Äú[1000 True Fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)*,*‚Äù¬†Kevin Kelly predicted that the internet would transform the economics of creative activities:

&gt;*To be a successful creator you don‚Äôt need millions. You don‚Äôt need millions of dollars or millions of customers, millions of clients or millions of fans. To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans.*  
*A true fan is defined as a fan that will buy anything you produce. These diehard fans will drive 200 miles to see you sing; they will buy the hardback and paperback and audible versions of your book; they will purchase your next figurine sight unseen; they will pay for the ‚Äúbest-of‚Äù DVD version of your free YouTube channel; they will come to your chef‚Äôs table once a month.*

But the internet took a detour. Centralised platforms became the dominant way for creators and fans to connect. The platforms used this power to become the new intermediaries - inserting ads and recommendations between creators and users while keeping most of the revenue for themselves.

Crypto, and specifically NFTs (non-fungible tokens), can accelerate the trend of creators monetising directly with their fans. Social platforms will continue to be useful for building audiences, although these too will be replaced with superior decentralised alternatives.

However, the only problem with NFTs is that beyond the surface level idea, no one knows what they are or how they actually work. It's time to shine a little light on them, how they work, and how not to get scammed.

#### What is an NFT?

Everyone knows the analogy of NFTs being collectables. Unfortunately this analogy is woefully inadequate at best, and actively malicious at worst.

NFTs as an umbrella term just means that each digital token on the network is unique. Each token contains a small bit of data that is unique to the token in question. That's it. They‚Äôre just little data containers being shipped around the blockchain between addresses.

Now, NFTs on specifically Ethereum (ETH) have a few data points that are unique to why anyone cares about them:

1. NFTs have their creators address saved as part of the NFT. Likewise, the current owner of the NFT is public information as well.
2. A royalty percentage can be programmed into the token. When the NFT token is traded at *any* time, between any two addresses for ETH or another currency, the royalty cut of that 'sale' will be redirected to the creators‚Äô ETH address.

It's important to understand one more aspect of NFTs. They are *very, very* small. It's absurdly expensive to store real data on a blockchain, even something as small as a 64x64 jpg. Most NFTs are only going to have a few bytes of data stored in them. For example, a serial number or URL.

In short, an NFT is basically a **unique scrap of paper with a serial number, password, or web address on it.**

#### What NFTs are NOT

They are *not* digital media. They do not store digital media on the blockchain. If you buy an NFT for some image or song, what you're really getting is a Token with a URL hosted on some random web server.

NFTs do not prevent copying, alteration, deletion, or any other actions regarding any digital or physical thing they link to.

NFTs do not inherently confer ownership over any assets they link to. NFTs are just unique tradable 'scraps' with a small amount of information scribbled on it.

#### Why NFTs?

There are three important reasons why NFTs offer fundamentally better economics for creators.

1. **Removing rent seeking intermediaries.**  
Once you purchase an NFT it is yours to fully control, just like when you buy a book in the real world. There will continue to be platforms and marketplaces but they will be constrained in what they can change or charge because the ownership of assets shifts power back to the creator and users.
2. **Granular price tiering.**  
In traditional models, revenue is generated more or less uniformly regardless of the consumers enthusiasm level. Crypto products can easily be sliced and diced into a descending series of price tiers capturing a much larger area under the demand curve based on consumers‚Äô enthusiasm level.
3. **Skin in the game.**  
NFTs change creator economics by making users owners. Customer acquisition costs are reduced to nearly zero. Crypto has grown to over a trillion dollars in aggregate market cap with almost no marketing spend. It's been able to grow so efficiently because users are owners - they have skin in the game. It's true peer-to-peer marketing, fuelled by community, excitement, and ownership.

#### How not to get scammed

1. Buying an NFT for 'ownership' of a thing when the seller doesn't own the thing to start with.
2. Buying an NFT for 'ownership' of a thing and getting non-exclusive rights, meaning the author can continue to mint infinite more NFTs of exactly the same thing.
3. Buying a 'collectible' NFT and the collectible site, host, or system goes under.
4. Buying an NFT for 'investment', only for that investment to have an exorbitant (50-100%) royalty fee. Meaning most of the proceeds of your investment go to the creator, instead of you, when you resell the NFT.
5. Buying an NFT and having the url host of the digital media go down, or the host changes the url so your NFT no longer shows what you bought.

#### Some other use cases

1. Cases where a website, app, or game can interact with the NFTs directly to show you your unique content, as proof of ownership of that content, although enforced by the host. ([NBA TopShot](https://www.nbatopshot.com/), [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/))
2. They make a good 'proof of attendance' or historical proof type tokens, which you could be given for attending a concert, getting your covid vaccine as a proof. ([POAP](https://www.poap.xyz/) \- The Proof of Attendance Protocol)
3. Similar to #2, NFTs are perfect for digital ticket sales. They can't directly be copied and even if they're sold on a secondary market, the original creator will get a cut of it. ([NFT.kred](https://www.nft.kred/events/tickets)) However, there are ways to still 'game' this.
4. They're great for money laundering. If you're buying some nonsense collectable picture of a cat on the internet, it's impossible to say you 'overpaid'. [Here's](https://www.coindesk.com/nyan-cat-nft-ethereum-meme) a Nyan Cat NFT that sold for $600k, opening the door to the Meme Economy.
5. Hedge against deep fake disinformation - we may need to use cryptographic signatures to prove origin or authenticity of a piece of content.

And remember, these are not just collectors‚Äô items, they are programmable assets that any developer can remix. As developers build new contexts for NFTs to live, there will be compounding demand from creators to have their work included in this emerging metaverse and for collectors to flex their ownership rights.

ethereum,"Is it profitable to turn my own art into NFT's? First of all, I'm relatively new to investing, crypto and NFT's but I've been a digital artist for years. I'm still studying but I've done commissioned posters before and I've gotten a surprising amount of social engagement around my work on various subreddits as well as Instagram. Over the years, I've consistently designed posters in my free time, mainly centred around sports. 

I'm really interested by Ethereum and the sudden NFT surge (as I'm sure everyone is) but I've also heard about how discouraging gas fees and minting costs can be. At least on Rarible, the sports trading card section is dominated by one seller and the quality of their work is low, but the demand is high as they sell for thousands of dollars. It's a relatively small, niche part of the NFT market, but it's dominated by a couple of sellers who are making bank.

Again, this whole NFT thing is extremely new to me, but I'd be interested in getting in as early as I can. I'm sitting on about a decade's worth of posters that do nothing but collect dust on my computer. You can view some of my work on my account, but I wonder how it would transfer to this marketplace, and whether it would be worth it or not.

Whats the best way to sell your own art? Where? Is it worth it?

I've always thought it was strange that forks are so contentious.   Members of the reddit-eth community, which I wouldnt consider indicative of the community at large, act with extreme vitriol to some of the side chains/or clones that are serving as trial grounds for the real deal (eth itself).  The success of these protocols should indicate there is some interest.

It seems to be dogma that a fork is a bad thing. Why? If you look at bch/btc split based on value (ie market cap) there was clearly interest and a purpose for bch.  In retrospect, rather than fighting the community could have probably gone about the fork earlier and more amicably."

ethereum,"How do NFT royalties work? Can anyone explain how royalties work? I can't understand how you can have an 'automatic' royalty based on a percentage (of sale price I assume?)? How can the token be aware of the sale price? Unless it's locked into some proprietary platform but wouldn't that make it far less valuable than a token you can transfer freely?

If there is a royalty based upon sale price, why wouldn't buyers and sellers just understate the sale price?

I can understand how you could have a static/fixed or graduating ETH fee in order to be able to transfer the NFT but how could this be aware of the sale price?

Also what are the favored standards for creating art NFTs that would be most compatible with the best platforms for initial sale and later resales?

""Some NFTs will automatically pay out royalties to their creators when they're sold. This is still a developing concept but it's one of the most powerful. Original owners of EulerBeats Originals earn an 8% royalty every time the NFT is sold on. And some platforms, like Foundation and Zora, support royalties for their artists.

This is completely automatic so creators can just sit back and earn royalties as their work is sold from person to person.

1. How do we elect which validator actually creates the block? I know it‚Äôs random but how does that random calculation work? I read about Randao, but is that model secure enough to help pick a validator? Wouldn‚Äôt it be insecure if the randao contract itself was running on the same blocks it‚Äôs helping to select who gets to mine? Could a malicious actor exploit how random numbers are chosen here so that they get to always be the validation who creates a block?

2. What is the benefit of having many validators agree on checkpoints? Why is it insufficient to just randomly choose a validator to create a block, and if everyone is running a node with the same consensus rules then nobody would consider using/building on top of a malicious/incorrectly constructed block

ethereum,"General Inquiry Re. Software Wallet Security and Cold Wallets Hey all,

My background is pretty ""all-over-the-place"" re. the crypto scene. I am currently lacking in some information regarding the storage of currencies, though.

I have been interested in Ethereum because of it's utility, and currently have some stored on a site hot-wallet.

For practical purposes, I would like to move this to a software-based wallet (Cold storage would be inconvenient, currently).

Currently, the considerations are Exodus and MetaMask.

My question regarding these platforms is:

\- If I have a system with one of these installed, if the software is closed, or not running, are there still security issues? Do they have background processes? What are primary concerns with software wallets?

\- If you make an image of your Operating System on a regular basis, isn't this essential backing up the private keys in the software, and functioning as an equivalent to cold storage?

Thanks all!"
ethereum,"Why the Merge Should Be Prioritized Over Data Sharding **Some Background**

The roadmap for Ethereum has evolved over the years, in good ways.  Not too long ago, ETH 2 was divided into phases, roughly as follows:

Phase 0: Staking on the Beacon chain (completed / happens today).  
Phase 1: Data Sharding.  
Phase 1.5: the Merge.  
Phase 2: TBD (this phase is/was the most nebulous; basically, there could be further improvements made to Ethereum).

**These Phases Need Not Happen Chronologically**

In recent months, Vitalik, Danny R., and others, have clarified that Phases 1 and 1.5 need not occur in that order.  In other words, the Merge could be prioritized and implemented before Data Sharding.  I urge the community to prioritize the Merge over Data Sharding for at least the following reasons:

* Rollup tech buys us time.  Both optimistic rollups and ZK rollups are now coming online.  These have the ability to scale Ethereum from less than 10 TPS to over 1000 TPS.  We gain at least two orders of magnitude of scaling with rollups.  Once major DAPPs such as Uniswap migrate to L2 (it is happening!), then fee pressure on L1 will be greatly alleviated.  And it is all happening in the short term, over the course of the next few months.  I estimate that this will provide at least 1 to 2 years before Data Sharding is needed to further scale Ethereum to 100,000+ TPS.
* Having the Merge at the ready provides a fallback for the community should a cartel of miners collude to neutralize the positive effects of EIP 1559.  There are some within the mining community who have threatened to form a group of miners to essentially prevent some aspects of EIP 1559 from having their intended effect.  While I believe it would be difficult or impossible for this group of miners to pull this off, there is a small chance that they might be successful.  The community would rightly interpret such an action to be an attack on the network.  The mere fact that the Merge is prioritized before Data Sharding might be enough to ward off such an attack like a Sword of Damocles, given that the Merge is the final separation of POW miners from the network.  This would further incentivize the mining community not to attempt to subvert the network.
* The Merge brings immediate liquidity to POS stakers who have tied up their ETH.
* The Merge is technically less complex than Data Sharding, albeit still with significant implications to the network.  It shouldn't be rushed, but it also should not be delayed.  Careful development with multiple testnets are obviously called for.  Overall, it is better to implement the technically-less-complex option having more immediate benefits to the community, and then shift community attention to the technically-more-challenging Data Sharding effort."

The first time you run new release of the client, it will run both of them in parallel, requiring **massive** amount of I/O operations.

In case of Raspberry Pi users like me, or if low-end SSD is used, **expect the node to temporarily fall out of sync.**

My setup is Rpi 4 + Samsung 860 EVO SSD, and for a period of ~24h node was lagging upto ~30 minutes behind the most recent block.

ethereum,"Expectations for backwards-incompatible changes / removal of features that may come soon The time between now and the merge, and possibly a little bit after the merge, is going to be a time of significant change for the Ethereum protocol. **These changes are needed for many reasons**: proof of stake and scalability, others to enable stateless validation, and others to simplify the protocol and make it easier to maintain it in the long term, all **setting the stage for a more sustainable long-term Ethereum protocol**. However, **some of these changes are backwards-incompatible, in that they may break existing applications or render them uneconomical**.

In all cases, these incompatibilities affect only a small portion of use cases, and there are alternative ways to get the same functionality, but nevertheless it's important to talk about these proposals early, so that developers have as much of a heads up as possible, and so that we have as much time as possible to refine the proposals to minimize disruption.

**After the merge** and the other important changes that are already in the roadmap today are complete, **I continue to think that it would be valuable for the Ethereum protocol to ""ossify""**, changing much less going forward so as to maximize developers' feeling of stability and ability to rely on protocol features. However, such an ossification is best done *after* we take into account our learnings from the past 6 years and make this one last push to make some major improvements to Ethereum.

This is my attempt at a partial listing of some changes that may happen.

See also: [this doc](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/evm_feature_removing), though the actual changes proposed there only cover the EVM, and this post is broader.

## History storage changes

* After the Ethereum application state is moved over to the beacon chain as part of **the merge**, we may want to discard the ethereum PoW chain, and no longer support any transaction or history queries going back into the PoW chain. **This greatly simplifies clients, as they can simply forget all the pre-merge protocol rules** and thus have a smaller and leaner codebase going forward, but it does mean that dapps that rely on looking back into history need to find some other way to do so.
* Even outside of the context of the merge, **we likely want to move toward a model where ""the network"" is only expected to be responsible for the most recent 1 year of history (including txs/blocks/receipts)**. This prevents clients from incurring ever-growing storage burdens, but it does once again mean that dapps that require old history will need an alternative way to get it.

## Statelessness / state expiry

See [my other post on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lw7ug3/weak_statelessness_andor_state_expiry_coming_soon/).

State expiry is definitely likely to be the one change in this list that requires the most significant changes for contracts; contracts that do not change probably will not *break* (as the most recent state expiry schemes ensure that if you can find a witness, you can continue using existing contracts as is for as long as you want), but developers *will* likely need to build new versions of contracts to remain gas-efficient.

## EVM changes

* [**EIP 2929**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929) **(going into the upcoming Berlin hard fork)**, changing how SLOAD and calls/account accesses are priced. The first time an account or storage slot is accessed is now about 3x more expensive, but subsequent accesses are around 5-10x cheaper. On average, this only increases gas costs paid by users by \~0.3%, but it significantly improves the chain's DoS resistance and bounds on witness size.
* **Gas repricing for code witness size**: when we add code Merklization, to finish the job of bounding witness size we will need to charge some cost per chunk of code accessed in a transaction (eg. 400 gas per 32 byte chunk accessed). In general, this would somewhat increase the gas cost of ""simpler"" transactions (eg. an ERC20 approval accessed about 16 chunks so about 6.4k gas would be added) but it would only negligibly affect more complex transactions that loop over the same code many times. Gas limits can be adjusted upwards so that on average scalability remains the same as it was before, but even still, some applications may need to be rewritten to remain economical.
* **Removal or neutering of SELFDESTRUCT**: see [this whole document](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/selfdestruct) for the rationale.
* [**Removal of refunds**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3298) (proposed for the London hard fork), or limiting how refunds work, with the main goals of reducing block gas usage variance and freeing up blockchain space and storage being used by gastoken contracts.
* [**Removal of the 2300 gas stipend**](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/evm_feature_removing#The-2300-gas-stipend): a simplification to the protocol, removing a hard-coded value and hence making future gas cost changes more feasible
* **Replacing some precompiles with EVM code implementations**: this could be done mainly to simplify the protocol and the client code complexity, but it would inevitably come with gas cost changes.

## Miscellaneous

* **Ethereum is switching from RLP + hexary Patricia trees to SSZ and possibly Verkle trees**. This means that contracts that verify Merkle proofs into history will stop working at some point and will need to be rewritten. To allow developers to make Merkle proofs going forward, one possible route is to make an explicit ""history/state proof verification precompile"", so that whenever the state structure changes the precompile can change too, but of course this has not yet been implemented.
* **Block hashes will no longer be a good source of randomness** after the merge.
* The `DIFFICULTY` opcode will be useless after the merge (duh)
* **In the long run, quantum computers will break ECDSA and BLS**, and so everything that uses ECDSA or BLS will have to switch, and even ethereum 2.0 itself will have to move from BLS to a post-quantum aggregable signature scheme. **Fortunately, there has been a lot of work done recently by Starkware and others on making such schemes more efficient**, so we are very confident that we will survive the transition; but contract developers should necessarily be aware that this will happen.

There are likely items that I have missed, but this covers at least some of the important things that are worth watching out for. I highly encourage application developers and others to participate in this process and do so early, so that the protocol changes that end up happening can be done in a way that is as minimally disruptive as possible."
ethereum,"List GWEI in $USD as well I totally get the reluctance to do so, but we really do need to express all this GWEI stuff in $ USD as well.

Why?

Cos it takes a loooong time to really get used to a new currency.

I've lived in SE Asia for about 16 years now, and I know it was at LEAST 5 years before I stopped looking at prices and quickly calculating what that meant in ""real"" money.

Now, today, I genuinely look at prices in Malaysian ringgit, and if I see a price in GBP or USD I now do the opposite, and quickly calculate what the heck that means in ringgit!

My point is money, and its currency, is really, really, deeply embedded in our heads. We cannot comfortably spend money without a little voice in the back of our head figuring it out in 'real money'. 

We can deny that, each of us can claim to be an exception, that you're so yung n trendi that you're not affected - but yes you are, and sure as heck noobs coming in are.

ethereum,"Interesting Ethereum Use Case? GoFundMe 2.0 As I have been stewing all day about how I can externally fund some my PhD costs starting in September aside from work in the Summer I came to two ideas: I start an OnlyFans and hope that there is a niche market of creepy guys that are into average looking 6.5 to 7.5 (on a good day) / 10 guys doing weird shit, or I start a GoFundMe and pray that enough people give a shit about economics and invasive species that they'll pitch in to help me achieve that personal goal. 

But then I looked at my cryptos today like I always fucking do and I thought to myself: Wouldn't it be great if there was a GoFundMe for cryptos? And then I thought that it could potentially be an easy use case for a dapp on Ethereum. It would be sooo easy for the GoFundMe donators to see that when enough money gets put in the pool that the smart contract could execute and do what it needs to do in the objective of the GoFundMe. 

So if I said for example that I wanted to try and pay off part of my tuition, the smart contract would build up enough crypto equivalents from the donations and then execute on an exchange or something to convert to stablecoins and send to the target wallet address (the university). This way if I donate to the GoFundMe I know for damn sure it's going to where it should be going instead of ending up in some guys back pocket or lost to fucking UniSwap on a bad trade."

ethereum,"Proof of Stake Computing Power? Posted about this before but it got flagged as spam and deleted.

Simple question: If the network is currently burdened as-is, how will \*reducing\* the computing power by transitioning to proof-of-stake benefit the ""global computer"" that is the Ethereum network in the long run? Or is that not the goal for the network?

I know with Proof of Work, there's currently a lot of garbage bundled with meaningful computation to artificially inflate the workload as a distribution mechanism. Will removing that garbage and vacating all of that computing power still leave a powerful cloud computer in its place? Or will the network's total computing potential be hugely cut back without hundreds of thousands of GPU and teraflops committed to the task?   


I guess it's a hybrid proof-of-stake, but the network without that garbage must still have steep computing demands, especially if it were to continue growing."

ethereum,"Weak statelessness and/or state expiry: coming soon (x-post from EthMagicians) One of the next major challenges for the Ethereum base layer is that  of dealing with the growing state size: currently around 100 GB  including tree nodes and growing by around 50 GB per year. The growing  state is making it increasingly harder to sync the ethereum chain and to  participate as a validator, and risks increasing network centralization  if the state grows, especially if the gas limit is increased further.

There are two main techniques being proposed for how to deal with this problem for the short term:

* **State expiry**: remove state that has not been recently  accessed from the state (think: accessed in the last year), and require  witnesses to revive expired state. This would reduce the state that *everyone* needs to store to a flat \~20-50 GB.
* **Weak statelessness**: only require block proposers to store state, and allow all other nodes to verify blocks statelessly.

Both solutions are well underway in development, and it feels like  around now is the time to switch gear from seeing these ideas as  research problems to seeing them as concrete paths of which at least one  (and perhaps eventually both) need to be implemented into Ethereum.

I'm looking for some more information regarding how NFTs might benefit artists with existing artwork or even the families of artists who have passed away. 

I understand that the smart contracts associated with NFTs can allow artists to receive perpetual royalties from resales of their digital art, as this is all executed online, including the delivery of the art. 

When it comes to physical art though, how would you go about including the percentage royalty in the NFT for physical art? Is it a matter as simple as it is with digital art where you just execute everything online except for delivery of the art? 

Could someone walk me through how this process might work with physical art? Are there any extra challenges compared to doing this with digital art?

ethereum,"A proposal for cross-rollup DEX (ethresear.ch) One of the challenges with rollups is that it is difficult to move between them: if you have funds in zksync but want to send them to someone who has a loopring account, currently the best approach is to withdraw to layer-1 and then re-deposit to loopring. This is really inefficient, costing you a full layer-1 gas fee, and furthermore it is very slow (especially with optimistic rollups where withdrawal takes a week). Here I propose a design for a decentralized/trust-minimized mechanism that allows users to move between rollups directly and potentially very quickly, as long as there is some liquidity provider willing to facilitate the trade. The mechanism only requires one side to be fully smart-contract/EVM capable; the other side can be a minimalistic rollup with no features other than sending coins. This mechanism could make life much easier for users trying to navigate the rollup ecosystem.
