Bitcoin,"Decentralization-Boosting Mining Protocol Stratum V2: Overview &amp; Progress Update Over the past year, we've explained many benefits of the Stratum V2 mining protocol **for miners, pools, and the Bitcoin network as a whole**. Now it's time for a recap &amp; update on development + adoption üëá

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/oqq4kyhm30m61.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb28be028fff3a67534abd209e8d1e009a8315e1)

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 &amp; BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&amp;A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners &amp; mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&amp;D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

&gt;[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ‚¨áÔ∏è

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/blog\/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization](https://preview.redd.it/vo0x4d1m50m61.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12daa1f9f8dc2f10b861759d8f465a08eb0b442)

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses."

Bitcoin,"Serious Question: What Happens When Bitcoin is Worth $40 Trillion? I will start this by saying I am neutral to Bitcoin and am playing Devil's advocate with this post.

There are three major concerns I have with Bitcoin, if it appreciates significantly. I have tried looking through this forum and through many other articles online, but have never found my concerns addressed, so I thought I want to try this community:

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitcoin Could Promote Greater Wealth Extremes**

Many people argue that Bitcoin is fairer than the current financial system by using the following two arguments:

1. A financial system based on Bitcoin would be much more equitable to everyone since it irons out some of the glaring issues with the current financial system (e.g., lending; real inflation not being captured)
2. Anyone can buy Bitcoin right now and share in the wealth that will be generated as price appreciates

The first statement (that I strongly believe is true) deals with the future, and not the path there. The path there is what I am concerned about since it could lead to significant destruction. 

[https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/#:\~:text=A%20recent%20report%20by%20Bloomberg,wealth%20in%20the%20Bitcoin%20network](https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/#:~:text=A%20recent%20report%20by%20Bloomberg,wealth%20in%20the%20Bitcoin%20network).

The glassnode link states ""2% of network entities control 71.5% of all Bitcoin."" Though the 71.5% is admittedly on the high side, it is alarming that there much wealth could be concentrated by such few participants. On the other end, some estimate that the top 1% own 40-50% of all wealth currently:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution\_of\_wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth)

It is impossible to tell whether the distribution is much more equitable (that I know of) than what we currently have, but it seems doubtful that low income earners, people on pensions, retirees, etc. are going to be investing at the same proportions as high net worth individuals (who could invest 10% of their entire portfolio in Bitcoin without the same risk to their living). People in Silicon Valley or global tech centers that were first aware of Bitcoin would disproportionately benefit from the rise, whereas those most disconnected from the centers of innovation would be left behind, which is not different/better than the current system. 

As Bitcoin rises, the current distribution will be more and more difficult to smooth out. As large investors start entering, it will become harder and harder for smaller players to have a significant share of the pie. People that do not invest in Bitcoin could be completely out of luck if Bitcoin goes to $10-40 trillion as some project. People that own Bitcoin could outbid those without on real estate, food, water, etc. That scenario is not much different than the current one, where ""using"" the financial system (e.g., trading in the stock market) can yield more wealth than doing productive work (e.g., working in the service industry, building factories, developing technologies). Governments would not be able to offer any kind of social safety net for those left behind because fiat currency would be effectively worthless in this scenario. A complete lack of confidence in any government body, and possibly even riots and looting would ensue by the disgruntled ""left behind.""

One could argue that the risk Bitcoin investors took by investing early warrants the wealth they accumulate. But my concern is that the same argument could be used for kings/dictators, and aligning with royalty early and suppressing others who were slow to pick-up later. That is not a sustainable system, because it would lead to failed states and rioting (e.g., Venezuela). 

Yes, most people could buy bitcoin right now. Yes, the access to bitcoin is somewhat equitable to a person‚Äôs current spot on the wealth distribution curve. However, information access is not necessarily equitable, and devaluation of fiat currency-based wage payments disproportionately disenfranchises the poor: shifts to Bitcoin expedite the devaluation.

Bitcoin could also cause easier tax avoidance, especially for the wealthy, expanding wealth gaps further.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitcoin Could Collapse the World Financial Market**

I think some people desire this outcome, but let me address my concern: 

You would struggle to find a single company with a market cap. above a penny stock that has outperformed Bitcoin this year. People could see that Bitcoin has risen 600-700% this year and decide that it is a better investment than equities, so they remove their wealth from equities and put it into Bitcoin, driving the price up, creating a positive feedback loop where equities drop, bitcoin falls, and the system encourages further redistribution. This would lead to a scenario where everyone wants Bitcoin but no one wants to invest in companies because of the rate of return difference. Companies would suffer without the support of investors, and productivity would greatly diminish, possibly leading to a global depression. This could happen with other assets such as commodities or real estate, but the liquidity of bitcoin and devout following is causing larger appreciation. So, we do not have a good historical comparison, to my knowledge.

I have heard the argument that Bitcoin's price would eventually flatten out as more participants enter and would stop rising after a point (although this is hypothetical), but if this took a year to happen, the damage could already be done. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Governments Could Step in or Become Useless**

If the two situations above look like they are on the verge of being realized, governments would be compelled to act, which brings me to my last point: governments could attempt to regulate or devalue Bitcoin. One scenario would be all the buy-in into Bitcoin causes governments to globally agree to disregard their fiat currencies and exchange all assets in their currencies, on an equal basis, into one decentralized token-based currency (not Bitcoin; a new one optimized to handle the large amount of transactions that would be involved). Therefore, everyone is starting from the same place, but all the improvements of removing fiat currencies will be realized. The counter argument is that countries like the US would never give up control over their currency since it gives them so much power, but I am not saying this scenario is at all likely, unless things changed dramatically, and they were desperate.

I will not even get into the fact that without means of controlling the financial system, it is certainly harder for governments to enforce global guidelines (e.g., with regards to nuclear weapons, terrorism, etc.). There is also nothing that can be done in economic crises to prevent a market collapse, but perhaps natural order implies that things should run their course. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**  

I want to be clear I am not attacking Bitcoin, and hope that someone has a good rebuttal (links or opinions) to any of these concerns. Thanks for reading!"
Bitcoin,"Everyone on this sub should have some sats in a mobile lightning wallet Next time the fees go below 10 sats/vB, use the opportunity to set up a non-custodial mobile lightning wallet (Phoenix, Muun, Breez, Eclair Mobile, Zap) and fund it with at least 30-50 USD/EUR/GBP (more if you want!). 

Once there, you've connected yoruself to the lightning network! congrats! And now you have sats that can be used for very small fees, no matter how high the fees are on the base layer. Don't think about it as 'locking up' your coins in 'channels', rather think of it as *liberating* your coins from the burden of onchain fees and slow confirmations: you can now pay stuff *instantly* with almost *no fees*.

And you can keep your wallet and sats within *for years*: no need to be online all the time as some people say, no need to worry about incoming liquidity, all these wallets have various ways to take care of that under the hood or as options given in  the menus.

And then play with it. Buy a gift card, buy bitcoin on an exchange that accept lightning payments, tips developpers, play games, pay your bills, buy food, lots of possibility, and much more to come in the coming years.

Join the LN now, it will be cheaper than doing it later!"
Bitcoin,"This is the Bitcoin Subreddit I've seen entirely too many posts and comments today that are obviously trying to shill 'NFTs', and where those comments and posts are very obviously vote manipulated.

If you want to discuss shitcoins, and why you think transferring ownership of freely duplicatable digital content on a blockchain for $1000's of dollars no one is going to pay is relevant in any way, go to the cryptocurrency subreddit.

If on the other hand you want to make a post about how Bitcoin is a revolution, and all other shitcoins are only a stepwise improvement on an already existing system where decentralization is arguably only slightly better than the current state of things, then that makes sense to post here."

Bitcoin,"I sold this week, and I am thankful! I‚Äôve been holding my Bitcoin for a couple years, buying weekly, and saving it all. 

This week, my spouse got in a car accident. We‚Äôre fine, car is not. We got through the initial stress of that to get to the even more stressful part of repairs and deductibles. The car will get fixed, but we certainly didn‚Äôt have that extra money in the bank this week. 

Thankfully, within minutes, we had it covered. I was able to transfer from my wallet to the exchange, sell, and had the funds in hand. It was fast, secure, and available exactly when I needed it. Literally the only thing that would‚Äôve made it any easier was if the insurance company accepted BTC directly, which is of course the big goal here. 

This is why we need to continue to educate people on the benefits of Bitcoin. Not even as an investment, but as security. Currency values will change, emergencies will happen where banking may not be the best option. BTC will stay secure and, as we continue to push, more widely accepted. 

Next paycheck I‚Äôll surely start building the stack back up. 

Keep up the good fight."

Bitcoin,"Is it wrong to think this way? Most of my life I have been a pretty small government type guy who borderlines on anarchism/agorism. Before Bitcoin I would have been a staunch non believer in government meddling in the economy. When the first rounds of QE was dropping I was losing my shit, preaching the dangers of hyperinflation to everyone. I was worried for my fellow people of this land. How we were heading for despotism. However,  now that there is a new paradigm that you can just simply opt into at any moments time I find myself caring less and less what government's are doing. If people simply have the choice to be free that is all I ever wanted. For people to live the way they see fit. Voluntarilyism. A peaceful revolution.  A shift in consciousness.  I find myself being less and less cynical of what the state does and in some cases I have started to embrace and welcome it. Let me explain. I know that the more money government prints the faster it is to their destruction. This definitely hurts people with no other way out. With Bitcoin though, the entire world has an out. I have started embracing stimulus and welcoming it. Encouraging keynsians and liberals and cheering them on because I know that their ideology is their own demise. Printing money just speeds up the enevitable death of their beliefs and system. All the while rewarding and enriching me and my fellow lovers of freedom. Growing our power and ultimately bringing about a peaceful revolution much sooner. It's kinda sad but kinda funny to me. I know in my heart I don't want anyone to suffer.  But you have a choice now and no one is stopping you but your own stubbornness. Bitcoin will be there for you. Is this the wrong way of looking at it? Does anyone else feel like this?"

Surely, you have encountered the argument of bitcoin critics/haters that bitcoin consumes a lot of electricity and energy. If you encounter this argument again, show them this statistic 

[ As you can see on the picture above, bitcoin is consuming less energy and helps saving natural resources.

Bitcoin,"Avoid buying from coinme (my experience) Ive been using coinme for the last month or so and have maybe bought 1200 worth of btc. I completed all the verification and had no problems up until 5 days ago. I purchased 300 dollars worth and never received a voucher. Instead I was prompted by the screen to call support with the information provided. 

I called immediately and then after not being able to speak to someone went through live support. After finally chatting with someone they required a bunch of documents and pictures to prove it was I who was making the purchase which I provided. I was told by support I'd receive a call within 72 hours...

Today, after no returned calls and minimal information from their terrible support system I contacted the BBB. Within an hour I received an email from coinme requiring more information and to fill out a form which I did. After doing so I expected the btc to be in my account. Come to find out after trying to log in now my accounts locked. Seems as if they locked me out because I contacted the BBB. So then I contacted them about that and now they are saying they want 3 months of bank statements and think I own a business which I don't. 

Long story short, this company is super shady. All I want is a refund or my btc. They have asked me for a ton of stuff which I provided and every time I do they require something else or tell me it's under review. Should have been a simple process, I was unable to redeem my bitcoin because I never got a voucher. I provided all of the required information and the bitcoin should have been placed in my account.

I am now considering a lawyer as I don't like their business practices. I've documented everything I've sent to them and all of the messages between us. I'm fed up!"
Bitcoin,"What are the some of the current best in-store payment methods for crypto? In Europe Hi guys,

I've been in crypto's since 2017 and so far havn't taken any money out of the market. But I would be very interested in paying with my crypto's to help promote adoption rather than converting back into fiat currencies myself. And to do that, I was planning on trying to convince a few local vendors to try out some of the crypto payment methods. Those that instantly convert to euro's to start with. And once they have a foot in the door, perhaps later they'll also consider direct crypto's. One of the major hurdles I've encountered so far is that they don't want exposure to crypto's directly, but would be open to accepting payments converted automatically and easily to fiat.

This one is mainly aimed at Europe, but I was wonder what some of the current best and easiest payment methods are to do this. And what are some of the best services to buy things with crypto's, like vouchers and gift cards, for example. Without KYC would be even easier, but not necessary.

Thank you!"

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Carbon Footprint - a fair comparison Bitcoin is recognised as a store of value making it comparable to gold. In 2020, 3,200 tonnes of gold was mined equating to approximately  90,301,440 million tonnes of CO2 emitted. 

In comparison Bitcoin is estimated to emit around 37 million tonnes of CO2 over the course of 2021, with China powering 65% of the hash rate in March 2021. China pledges to be net zero by 2050 along with most of the world under the Paris agreement. Under the assumption this is achieved this would indicate Bitcoin would be powered by renewable energy by 2050 making it a zero carbon technology. 
In addition, gold mining is renowned to be one of the most destructive industries responsible for polluting drinking water with cyanide, mercury and other heavy metals, whilst destroying pristine environments and causing damaging health effects. Removing reliance on the need for gold not only has the potential to decarbonise the gold reserve industry but also reduces these negative environmental and health impacts. However, the reliance on countries sticking to the Paris Agreement is needed in order to decarbonise Bitcoin. 

Edit: Information on China‚Äôs energy policy 

China uses the most cost effective renewables and could viably generate 60% of its energy with green energy by 2030.  It is estimated the renewable energy implementation could save China around 11% in monetary cost. Feasibly following the laws of economics Bitcoin miners will be more likely to use renewable energy sources if they are cheaper. Therefore, reducing Bitcoin‚Äôs carbon footprint.

Bitcoin,"Help people buy Bitcoin! Recently, I have noticed that it has become incredibly difficult to convince people that they need Bitcoin. This is due to the fact that, apparently, they already know.

I've onboarded multiple people over the last few weeks, and all it took was mentioning my Bitcoin knowledge in their presence. They already knew it was a good idea to buy, they just didn't really know how, and were a little too lazy to try to figure it out for themselves.

People like Bitcoin now. Even if it's sometimes just for the gains, it's pretty easy to get the ""literally just hodl"" strat across.

So remember: Help people buy Bitcoin! You know the exchanges, you know the wallets, you might even know lightning. It's surprisingly easy to get people to buy! Give them a good exchange and a good wallet to use, and tell them to just hodl, and back up their wallets!

I buy bitcoin with cashapp which is owned by square. So I'm helping them aquire bitcoin. If bitcoin takes off to mars then square probably will too.

As of for tesla... Them being an early corporate adopter means that If it skyrockets passed 100k then my tesla shares will go up with it. 

While this may be a simplistic view supporting the companies that support my currency of choice will help progress bitcoin to a globally accepted currency.

Bitcoin,"The traditional banking and monetary system = anxiety. Bitcoin = self-possession and tranquility. Having dollars in a bank gives me nothing but anxiety. Will my bank block an ATM withdrawal for no reason? Will my bank block some transaction due to a stupid algorithm fault?  Will my bank card be blocked because its sensitive data was stolen online? Will my bank block a transfer simply because its heading overseas? Will I end up travelling overseas and have my accomodation payment blocked because i lost my phone with my sms 2fa code on it leaving me with no where to sleep? Will my bank pull a Cyprus and ""haircut"" my savings? Will my bank collapse due to another financial crisis? Will the dollars I hold in a bank be inflated to infinity?

There is no real trust in the current system, people just hope that everything keeps working day to day.

With bitcoin I have complete control of my money and the laws of mathematics prevent any form of inflation. I know with certainty that whenever I want to transact I can no matter how much I want to send, when I want to send it, where I want to send it, even if its the middle of the night and im sending it half way around the world.

Bitcoin,"Don't be an ignuranus like me So I know that everyone and their grandfolks have a story about how they missed out on Bitcoin back in the day. Hindsight is 20-20 ,yadda yadda. My story is a little bit different, and mostly I hope to share a good lesson on how to not be an ignoranus.

The year is right about 2014 give or take. I'm listening to two guys pitching the concept Bitcoin in a fancy auditorium  where startups and other companies present and share ideas. My brain is actively tuning them out, I'm not even  listening because I've already made up my mind that this is some scam, because the bitcoin logo looked like something you'd see when you accidentally clicked on an ad.

Fast forward another year or so, watching a streamer talk about it, as it's now at an all time high of $400. I'm thinking how crazy it is that it gained so much traction and value. Being a computer person got me intrigued but then quickly decide it's too convoluted even for me as an excuse to be lazy.

Forward another couple of months and I'm looking to buy a graphics card to play Skyrim on release. The seller saying they used to mine Bitcoin with it. The actual concept felt like something I enjoy to do, so I think I joined a mining pool but then just decided it was too noisy and didn't bother doing any setup in the basement, that I'd much rather just use the GPU to play games with.

The thing that upsets me the most is that I had plenty of opportunity. Yet because of my ignorace and  lazyness I never took the chance to educate myself. This isn't about me ""losing out"", realistically back then I would have probably sold a long time ago.  It is rather the feeling of doing nothing and gaining nothing, having no potential. Imagine I had no money back then and only learned about how it worked, that would still be very useful knowledge I could act on in the future.

So these last few weeks I finally got my self a hardware wallet, learned how the techonology works on a decent level, read about the prospects in terms of investing in BTC as an asset, gained inforation and from different sources, spun up my own electrum personal server, and, yes I actually bought Bitcoin that I plan to HODL to diversify my portfolio (and also because I still believe it's undervalued).

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; TLDR:

The moral of the story is to be more open minded. Don't be lazy. Invest (or not) after you've considered the circumstanes. Obviously the question then becomes 'what should be considered important to investigate' but as long as your're curious it shouldn't matter, as long as you come to your own conclusions."

Bitcoin,"Crypto Wallets: which one is right for you Wait, can‚Äôt I just leave my crypto on the exchange I purchased them on? Well, that depends on a few factors, but let us start from the beginning. 

**What**

Your crypto wallet is what you use to interact with a blockchain network and falls under one of three categories: a paper, software or hardware wallet.

Now, there are different use cases, but the tl;dr is hardware wallets are the most secure method of storing your crypto, with software being the most convenient and paper wallets being widely considered obsolete/unreliable. 

**How**

The first thing to understand about wallets is that they don‚Äôt actually store your crypto. They are merely vessels through which you can interact with a blockchain allowing you to send and receive the required information in order to perform transactions on said blockchain. 

Examples of this information include:

1. Your public keys
2. Your private keys. Never share this with anyone as it will mean they are able to access your crypto. Also remember, if you don‚Äôt own the private keys, you don‚Äôt own the crypto. Looking at you, Robinhood! Your private keys (or seed phrase) will also allow you to access your crypto on any device and that‚Äôs because your crypto never actually leave the blockchain, they just change from one address to another.
3. An assigned address that you will use to receive or send crypto to and from your wallet, which acts as a location on the blockchain. It‚Äôs okay if your address is public. When sending or receiving crypto, always ensure you are sending crypto to the right address.

**Hot vs Cold** 

Hot wallets are any wallets that are connected to the internet. Your crypto is very accessible and trading with your crypto is convenient.

Cold wallets have no connection to the internet making them less likely to be compromised by those evil people who want your precious crypto. Cold wallets usually come in the form of a USB drive device that stores a user‚Äôs private keys securely. If you‚Äôre a loooooooong-term HODLer, this may be the option for you.

A cold wallet is a physical device that uses a random number generator (RNG) to create public and private keys. The device, which is not connected to the internet, is home to these keys, making it a cold wallet and as a result arguably the most secure methods to store your crypto.

**Software wallets**

**Web wallets**

Web wallets make it possible to access your crypto, without having to install software - think metamask (browser) and your exchange wallet. You create a password to access your crypto, but in some cases, the provider will hold the private keys. Again, if you don‚Äôt own the private keys, you don‚Äôt own the crypto. If you‚Äôre leaving your crypto on the exchanges, set up multi-factor authentication,¬†anti-phishing code, and¬†withdrawal address management.

**Desktop wallets**

If you opt for a desktop wallet, you will be installing software onto your computer and you‚Äôll be able to manage your crypto through that. You will have your private keys, which are stored locally on your computer. Encrypt it with a password as an extra precaution. BACKUP YOUR PRIVATE KEYS AND PASSWORDS because by doing so, you will be able to access your crypto on another device. Scan your computer regularly for viruses, malware etc.

**Mobile wallets**

These are very similar to desktop wallets but operate on‚Ä¶you guessed it, mobile devices making it incredibly convenient to send, receive and spend your crypto on the go. Again, BACKUP YOUR PRIVATE KEYS AND PASSWORDS.

Paper wallets are exactly that - pieces of paper with a crypto address and its public and private keys printed on it in the form of a QR code. A major flaw to this option though is that you are only able to transfer the entire balance to an address, making it the wrong option when wanted to send a smaller amount to an exchange to trade or to another address to purchase something. As stated above, this method is somewhat dated and is considered dangerous. 

**Finally, BACK UP YOUR SEED PHRASE AND PASSWORDS!**"

Bitcoin,"Help  

Hi guys!

I  am probably not the first to ask something like this, but i can't seem  to find the answer anywhere. So, back in 2017 i bought some Bitcoin on a  p2p exchange. I was young at the time and my technical knowledge was  not very impressive. I had just downloaded bitcoin core and it was still  syncing. Regardless I sent my bitcoin to the wallet. What happened then  was my computer ran out of memory, and the syncing stopped. In my head  the logical solution was to simply transfer all of the bitcoin core  files to my external HDD to continue this process. Obviously this did  not work out and i never understood how to fix it. Years have passed and  I still have the files stored on my HDD, and the file wallet.dat.

My  question is; is there any way to use the wallet.dat to regain my coins?  Preferably without having to download the entire blockchain once  again(more than 350GB now, and I have really bad internet). Any good  input would be so much appreciated and I would be so happy if a  restoration was possible. Again, I have looked everywhere but cant seem  to find any good solutions."

Bitcoin,"P2P Lending with HodlHodl using Bitcoins Beautiful concept adhering to the rule 'Not your keys, not your bitcoins'

Seems to me this way is safer to lend your bitcoins and gives, atleast at the moment, a higher return than block (=16%-40%)

And how amazing it is that you can create your own contract and form your own conditions!!!

For example you can chose to create a contract of lending 10k$ worth of bitcoins for 16 pct return in 3 months and the counter party has to provide 100% collatoralisation (so if you deposit 0.2 BTC, counter party deposits 0.4 BTC).

And according to this podcast there are three keys. One key to lender, one to the one who lends and one to HodlHodl. You need two keys of the three to open the 'escrow'. If there is a dispute, Hodl Hodl can interfere and you can still get your keys in that case. But since they have only one key, they cannot move it on their own!!!

Bitcoin,"Anyone who owns 21 bitcoins is a millionaire today. *An important event has happened in the history of bitcoin. Now the one-millionth part of the Bitcoin supply is worth $ 1 million.*

**Anyone who owns 21 bitcoins, or one millionth of the total supply, is a millionaire today.**

Back in 2017, financial publications announced the emergence of a group of crypto enthusiasts ‚Äúhunting‚Äù for exclusive membership in the ‚Äú[*21 Million Club*](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-21-million-club-more-exclusive-by-the-day-2017-12)‚Äù. Also over the past years, there have been many forum posts about people who have finally ended up in the exclusive club of owners who own one bitcoin (BTC). The r / Bitcoin subreddit has [a whole topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1q8uv3/owning_1_btc_is_slowly_getting_out_of_reach_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) dedicated to those wishing to accumulate 1 bitcoin.

*Each member of the 21 million club who owns one BTC now owns exactly 0.0000047619% of the total BTC supply*.

Members of another club of crypto millionaires, who managed to collect 21 BTC or 0.0000999999% of the total limited supply of bitcoins, join [the 21-BTC CLUB](https://21-btc.club/). Membership in the club is informal and symbolic. Club members are recommended the best crypto wallets, among which Trezor is in the first place, the best exchanges, they teach how to pay taxes correctly and share the best information resources on the topic.

*Many people ask why Satoshi Nakamoto chose the 21 million Bitcoin emission limit?* There are many versions.

For example, Ph.D. Christian Seberino explained in 2018 that Satoshi most likely chose 21 million in order to ‚Äúuse floating point arithmetic.‚Äù You can read more about this [here](https://medium.com/@cseberino/why-21-million-bitcoins-was-a-great-idea-bd2533af0f63).

However, according to e-mail correspondence between Mike Hearn and Nakamoto, the inventor of bitcoin has chosen a limit of 21 million to match the M1 money supply of fiat currencies such as the euro and the US dollar. Back in 2008, when Nakamoto published the White Paper, the M1 money supply was roughly $ 21 trillion. By simple calculations, we get the predicted Bitcoin price of $ 1 million by Satoshi Nakamoto.

‚Äú*I wanted to choose something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but not knowing the future, it is very difficult. I ended up choosing something in between‚Äù,*¬†Nakamoto said in an email to Hearn.

Summarizing all this information, we can assume that even **owning 0.1 BTC will make any person a dollar millionaire during his lifetime**. Not to mention the fact that having collected 21 bitcoins, a person will automatically enter the 1% of the richest people on the planet."

I just want to convert everything in BTC as i believe the future lies in BTC. LTC hardly reaches the news and it just doesn't do anything to be honest.

Do you think this will be taxed in Belgium if I convert everything now into BTC? I'm not even sure if I made a profit to be honest. I'd have to double-check, but let's say I make the trade into BTC. Do you think I need to pay taxes on the profit?

After years of wanting to get into bitcoin, I was finally able to buy in a few weeks back. Yay! 

I understand that the general sentiment on here is against trading, but I want to try dabbling in it to learn a bit about trading with a small amount outside of my hodl bag. 

I am using bybit, but I think I might be a bit confused with how to properly do risk management with 10x leverage. 

Say my account is $1000 and I want to only risk 1% per trade. 

I do my calculations and my stop loss will be at 1.5% below my buy price. My liquidation price is below that. 

Using: position size = $10 (risk) / .015 , I get a position size of $666. 

Does this mean that if I wanted to use 10x leverage, I should be buying $6660 contracts with my position margin being $666? And if I do hit the SL, does that still mean that I just lose $10 or (1.5% of my position margin)? 

If that‚Äôs correct, what would be the downside of using 20x leverage instead to buy $13320 contracts if the liquidation price is still below my SL?

Bitcoin,"TL:DR Institutional alternative to ca$h and Coinbase? Hello all, was curious what some of the community thoughts on established financial institutions ‚Äì and explicitly how to convert BTC to fiat. (I am in the US)

TL:DR alternatives to ca$h being just sucking up and using coinbase (again)  vs haveing access to institution where selling decent amounts for fait is doable. 

I know why Coinbase and ca$h stink, I know the benefits of owning your own keys - and something I have been exploring - but even this hits the problem of limits that ca$h imposes on moving BTC out.

my concern long term is if I needed to liquidate BTC ‚Äì it might take quite some time to get the fiat to me. It‚Äôs not an urgent issue and these are good problems to have.

Bitcoin,"What will happen if everyone started selling their Bitcoins? Sounds absurd but I was puzzled when this thought stuck me. Exchanges give you Bitcoins for your government issued currency (USD). Suppose you bought 1 Bitcoin when its price was 20$, so paid 21$ to Coinbase (some charges may be). Now that Bitcoin is traded at a rate of 55000$, you chose to opt out of it. Now Coinbase will have to transfer this amount to your bank account.

Bitcoin,"Devote ONE single year to acquire Bitcoin out of your 30-40 career... it may harvest monumental results of life changing, unimaginable wealth. Here‚Äôs the way I see it, and I may be wrong, so feel free to tell me to take a hike üòä 

I would venture to say that the average person is in the workforce for 30-40 years. 

This is a special moment in time for Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) before it goes mainstream. As such, prices are up, but when it actually reaches mass adoption, the price will hockey stick up and to the right from here. 

Why not devote *this* year... just *one year* to acquiring Bitcoin? What does that hurt?

If you end up being wrong, you still have 29-39 more years to invest in 401k, blah blah blah. 

*But* if you happen to be right and Bitcoin does explode, the single year that you devoted to investing in it could be monumental, life changing money.

Bitcoin,"Goldman Sachs says high BTC returns in 2021 will destroy everything on Wall Street It was not until the end of January that Goldman Sachs compared BTC with global assets. Nevertheless, since 2021, the rate of return of BTC has been twice that of the energy industry.

&amp;#x200B;

In January, Goldman Sachs, a well-known Wall Street investment company, began to include Bitcoin in its weekly global asset class return rankings. That month, BTC quietly climbed to the top of the rankings.

&amp;#x200B;

But since then, BTC's advantages have expanded relative to assets such as stocks, bonds, oil, gold, bank stocks, technology stocks, and the euro.

&amp;#x200B;

In its latest U.S. Weekly Kickstart report, Goldman Sachs Group showed that as of March 4, the return rate of BTC was about 70%, followed by the energy industry with a return rate of 35%.

&amp;#x200B;

The U.S. stock market has recently sold off, and the return of the S&amp;P 500 index is currently close to zero. In contrast, the advantage of BTC is even more obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

1. For cyclical industries such as energy and finance, the rebound in oil prices and the increase in real interest rates have pushed up the current rate of return, but the performance is still inferior to BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

2. At present, the risk-adjusted capital return rate of crude oil and energy is higher than that of BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Gold is the worst-performing asset class so far this year, because traditional defensive industries such as consumer daily necessities and public utilities have been affected due to rising real interest rates.

&amp;#x200B;

4. According to previous CoinDesk reports, in cryptocurrency and traditional markets, many investors believe that BTC is a potential inflation hedging tool, especially now that central banks around the world have issued a large number of additional issuances to boost the economy affected by the new crown virus. Even so, from the beginning of the year to now, the price of gold has fallen by about 10%, so some market observers believe that BTC is eating away at the gold market share.

&amp;#x200B;

5. According to a survey, approximately 40% of Goldman Sachs customers have invested in cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Even so, in May 2020, Goldman Sachs' asset management department stated in a statement that for customers, cryptocurrency is not a suitable investment, driven by speculation behind it, and is more famous than the notorious Dutch tulip in the 17th century. The bubble is even crazier."

This is because there are no (widespread) physical options to buy BTC, so I had to wait to get a debit card and a salary. Still, I have a small amount of physical dollars I would much like to put into bitcoin, but I can¬¥t.

My point is that having physical locations where to anonymously buy satoshis (worldwide, I know there are a few) would encourage people with physical savings to purchase."

Bitcoin,"So I have finally setup my FIRST hardware wallet and sent funds to it successfully! I officially own my BTC! (I‚Äôm using a new account because I don‚Äôt want anything linked back to me from my post history or comments) So I really didn‚Äôt understand all the language used for transactions and it seemed really intimidating but I know the most important thing is if you don‚Äôt have private keys or the seed words to the hot wallet you are using then you essentially don‚Äôt own your Bitcoin. So I was dedicated into looking at other wallets... through here, YouTube, and cold/hot wallet websites and that led me to want nothing but a cold wallet with fully offline signing (which I now know what that means fully by doing it myself so I‚Äôm learning slowly but surely). 

The cold card drew me in the most because of it only using BTC, all of the features and the style it had to offer. Ledger just recently had security issues and I didn‚Äôt like the features or style of the two different versions from Trezor. Even though many said the ledger and trezor are more beginner friendly, I did so much research to familiarize myself with how the cold card works and I felt confident enough to transfer it to the hot wallet and then to my cold card after also learning about the hot wallet of my choice. IIRC the more expensive trezor still had you use it with a computer which in my eyes defeats the purpose of a cold wallet so the micro sd feature of the cold card sold me even though it seemed like a lot to do but I‚Äôd go out of my way to keep myself and my asset secure! I‚Äôve learned so much after setting up my wallets and successfully transferring them into my actual possession! I am very good with tech so maybe that‚Äôs why it helped me understand the cold card as a beginner but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs that very hard to understand after learning with a lot of research! 

I feel secure now, I can finally sleep in peace and won‚Äôt have to check my hot wallet every second to see if it‚Äôs still there because I literally was that scared I‚Äôd lose it somehow. Seeing my first transaction on the blockchain was exciting and that also helped me understand why so many addresses I would look at had only one transaction! But thanks to this sub I learned to ease the nerve wrecking anxiety of sending or receiving funds you just need to verify the address is correct manually where the phrase/slogan comes to mind ‚ÄúDONT TRUST, VERIFY.‚Äù ! And I did that many times just to learn and ofc verify! I even learned how to use kleopatra to verify I wasn‚Äôt downloading any malware. 

For anyone wondering how long shipping took, well it didn‚Äôt really take that long tbh like with covid restrictions and going through customs it was surprisingly fast but my anxiety was through the roof because I didn‚Äôt want to lose my funds so it felt like it took forever. I ordered it the last week of February and received it yesterday which I would‚Äôve got it Saturday but it was weekday delivery only. 

P.S. hey bot Ik there‚Äôs scammers and I‚Äôll just report them, not reply and not click on anything random because that‚Äôs probably one of the first things I learned about bitcoin is that scams are aplenty sadly. 

TL;DR I have learned how to secure my BTC offline and now everything is coming together slowly but surely!"
Bitcoin,"Perspective I see many people trying desperately to equate crypto to stocks. This morning I saw a post where somebody said ‚Äúmy dividends have doubled‚Äù when referencing an altcoin. When I first dove into crypto I read someone explaining that BTC is more like land versus gold and I agree. Land can gain value, lose value, or stay the same just like gold. Land is a scarce resource like gold. Here is where BTC take a hard turn away from gold....

Land ownership is recorded in perpetuity through local governments. BTC transactions are recorded in perpetuity on the blockchain. Land can be liquid but it‚Äôs a slow process to make it liquid. BTC is liquid but it‚Äôs slower than other crypto currencies to off ramp to fiat. Land, in many communities, is a status symbol. BTC is evolving to be something that will be a status symbol.

Bitcoin,"Fee structure in the future Hi everyone, I‚Äôm looking to have a discussion on a topic I am relatively unsure about. I know that in the near future Bitcoin network fees will overtake block rewards for the majority of income for miners. My question really is, will network fees get so high to push small individual players off the network? I know that the main chain is used for large transactions, but I think if the fees get to be $50+ it will be really painful even for the biggest transactions for smaller players. I understand that Lightning is a great solution for smaller transactions, but don‚Äôt you need to do on an on chain transaction each time you want to open a Lightning channel between you and another party? Also, is there any chance future technology can be implemented to Bitcoin to lower transaction fees or increase efficiency without requiring a hard fork? It just seems to me like we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, miners need to make their money to keep the network secure. But on the other hand, without block rewards this fee will be very high relative to the number of transactions the network can support.
Any comments would be appreciated. I am a huge bull for Bitcoin but this is one of the things that concerns me. I know that people can group transactions but if in the future the network is entirely taken up by corporations that group transactions for people, I feel like Bitcoin will have lost much of one of its main appeals."

&amp;#x200B;

 (Bloomberg) -- Tucked away among the Ford, Dodge and Chevy sedans, the 12,000-gallon storage container and the inoperable Caterpillar tractor being auctioned off by the U.S. government is an unusual item: 0.7501 of a Bitcoin.

The U.S. General Services Administration typically uses its auctions to sell surplus federal equipment to the general public. With lot 4KQSCI21105001, which goes up for auction in a week, the government is offering an amount of Bitcoin worth about $38,000 at Monday‚Äôs price.

The government doesn‚Äôt say where its surplus digital currency came from. And while it‚Äôs a far cry from the 30,000 Bitcoins auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals Service in 2014 after they were seized from the Silk Road marketplace, the GSA auction is one more indication of how Bitcoin is becoming more and more mainstream.

On Wall Street, too, there is a newfound openness to the world‚Äôs most valuable digital currency: Custody banking giant Bank of New York Mellon Corp. said it will hold, transfer and issue digital currencies, while Mastercard Inc. announced plans to let cardholders transact in certain cryptocurrencies on its network. A Morgan Stanley unit known for picking growth stocks is considering adding Bitcoin to its possible bets and, last week, a person close to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the bank plans to reopen a trading desk for cryptocurrencies.

The Bitcoins auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals Service in 2014 were estimated at the time to be worth about $19 million, though the winning bid -- by venture capitalist Tim Draper -- wasn‚Äôt disclosed. Those coins would be worth $1.5 billion today as the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price has skyrocketed to almost $51,000.

The GSA auction is scheduled to be held from March 15 to 17."

Bitcoin,"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust premium is currently negative. Why? I know most of us are anti-GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) because ""not your keys, not your Bitcoin,"" but the other argument was that GBTC almost always costs *more than Bitcoin.* Just as recently as December, you would pay 40% more for GBTC than had you just purchased Bitcoin outright. Today, however, Bitcoin is 10% more expensive than GBTC.

*Before we continue, here is my disclaimer: I hodl mostly real Bitcoin. I'm no GBTC shill, and I don't condone a full ""bitcoin portfolio"" in GBTC only. But it is of course near impossible to keep actual Bitcoin in my Roth IRA, so I use GBTC for that purpose. I also like to swing trade GBTC in my taxable account. I will attempt to sell the top with GBTC during this bull run (I don't believe we are there yet), but I will hodl my actual Bitcoin.*

For those who are unaware, GBTC is the stock ticker for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. It is not a true Bitcoin ETF, as this is privately run and has to be traded over the counter in your stock account. But it is an easy way to get Bitcoin exposure if you have an existing brokerage account. The way GBTC works is Grayscale holds actual Bitcoin, and you purchase shares of their trust, effectively taking ownership in a share of their Bitcoin holdings. For each Bitcoin Grayscale owns, they have issued roughly 1000 shares of their trust. Now this isn't the actual number, but its close to it. It allows you to do the math in your head. If Bitcoin is worth $55,000, GBTC should be worth roughly $55 per share. On to the real numbers:

Currently, [on their website](https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/), Grayscale quotes their ""Bitcoin per Share"" at 0.00094664. To get the ""fair value"" for a share of GBTC, you simply multiply this number by the spot price of Bitcoin. At this moment, Bitcoin is $54,420, which means a share of GBTC should be worth at least $51.52. It's not however. The current spot price of GBTC is $48.72, giving GBTC a negative 10% premium. That means it's literally 10% cheaper at this moment to purchase some of Grayscale's bitcoin than it is to purchase some on your own.

Now you might be thinking, ""maybe it's always like this,"" but I assure you it's not. If you look at a chart of [GBTC premium](https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav) you'll notice it's almost always positive. I remember back in 2017, that at one point, GBTC premium was over 100%!

So what's happening? I have a few theories. Actual Bitcoin is becoming easier to buy, which is a long term attack on GBTC premium, but if you look at the chart, you'll see this is a recent anomaly. Premium went negative at the end of February. I believe this is because GBTC has gotten wrapped into the greater stock market tech sell off and has been way oversold.

So what do we do about it? Well, purchasing GBTC today is looking a lot like a leveraged buy into Bitcoin to me. If the rocket takes off past $60k, retail stock investors are going to pile back into GBTC driving the premium positive again, meaning you will see larger percentage gains in GBTC than you will in Bitcoin.

To give you an example, there is somebody from US who is ready to buy a painting, and I'm trying to work out how to proceed with the transfer of money. So the question for you is whether it would it be a viable option to start selling in bitcoin? How easy would it be for people wishing to buy my art to pay in bitcoin if they do not have any prior knowledge of the system? On one side, bitcoin is something I wanted to get in for the last 10 years but I wasn't in a position to do so unfortunately, on the other, I fear that it might be too complicated for people who have never dealt with bitcoin to arrange a payment and thus I will loose buyers.

Bitcoin,"Could the network be centralized by paying miners to censor transactions? I am concerned that governments can achieve 51% attack and censor bitcoin transactions in the future by following these steps:

  
1) Governments start supporting miners with tax cuts (or with cash) to mine BTC within their jurisdiction.  
2) Miners will flock to these countries because of profits  
3) Wait for &gt;50% of hash power to establish within these grouped governments.  
4) Pass a law that dictates that only ""authorized"" transactions can be included in blocks, and blocks containing ""unauthorized"" transactions must be ignored.  
5) 51% attack is achieved.

Last year I started investing and lost a good chunk of money, more than I made so I'm clear for this April (already filed all my transactions - highly recommend keeping a Google sheet of every time you buy and sell and the dollar value). But this year I'm up significantly already and it's March. 

So my question is, has anyone taken their 35% gains and given to charity instead of Uncle Sam? This would be (imho) a better use than giving it back to the government (of course depending on the charity).

15% if you wait a year to withdraw from your HODL bag, but I've gotten into futures trading and will likely count that as capital gains.

Bitcoin,"Personal gambling story... Prior to crypto I would go to a casino three or four times a year where I loved to shoot craps. I was a bad gambler because I walked up to the table each day with a set amount of money knowing that I wouldn‚Äôt walk away with a dime. I saw it as entertainment no different than buying a concert ticket. I could get several hours of play out of $200 and when it was done I‚Äôd walk away and a good time was had by all. 

Crypto has given me a paradigm shift that ‚Äúscratches‚Äù my gambling ‚Äúitch‚Äù AND I‚Äôm building wealth instead of throwing money at a casino and walking away with empty pockets. 

My crypto strategy has evolved to be similar to my craps strategy. Have to keep the bulk of my money in conservative bets (BTC) so I can play longer. Then I set a small chunk aside for high risk/high reward bets (the three altcoins I have). 

Thus far my craps to crypto journey has been one of the best things to happen to me as I approach 40 years on this earth. My life as a farmer is based upon a little physical labor and a lot of speculation. Crypto is no different...a little research and a lot of speculation. 

Every cent I have in crypto I see just like the money I wasted shooting craps...every cent I‚Äôve put into crypto I‚Äôm just fine if I never get it back which makes the profits even sweeter! If crypto disappears toMorrow I won‚Äôt miss a meal but at the rate we are going I don‚Äôt see that happening!!! 

One last anecdotal comment...I‚Äôve always thought Roulette was a stupid game. For some reason I have no remembrance of why but I started a ‚Äútradition‚Äù with roulette. When I walk into a casino I go straight to the roulette table and put down the table minimum bet , most of the time $5 or $10, on red 15. After losing my $5 or $10 I would start picking a craps table. Now, when I enter my new casino, Coinbase Pro or Crypto.com , I ‚Äúbet‚Äù $5 on a low market cap coin I‚Äôve done minimal research on or saw on Reddit. Then I get on with business setting my weekly order for BTC  and putting my smaller amounts into the three altcoins. BTC and my three altcoins are my portfolio and then the $5 I put into random ‚Äúmoonshot‚Äù coins I affectionately refer to as my shitfolio. Between my shitfolio and my portfolio maybe one day I‚Äôll hit it big!"

Bitcoin,"German Bundesbank: ""We want to have reserves that are valuable and liquid and, if necessary, quickly available in an emergency,"". Article originally in German (below):

09.03.2021 - 20:03 Uhr

""More and more private investors are acquiring Bitcoins - but not the German central bank.

The Bundesbank is unlikely to hold bitcoins as a reserve currency, according to one of its leaders.

""I doubt that we will ever do that,"" said Bundesbank board member Burkhard Balz in an interview with ""WirtschaftsKurier"", which the German central bank published on its website on Tuesday.

Balz: ""The Bundesbank is the second largest gold owner in the world. We want to have reserves that are of value and liquid and, if necessary, quickly available in an emergency,"" Balz said.

Bitcoin cannot offer that, unlike the yellow precious metal and foreign currencies such as the US dollar or the Japanese yen.

And further: ""Bitcoin cannot be seriously compared with gold,"" said Balz. Gold has an intrinsic value that has been preserved over centuries and therefore means security and liquidity at all times. ""Bitcoin does not offer that.""

Funny how he searches for values exactly as bitcoin inherits but credits gold with the same properties such as liquid and fast available.

After the fact that I came to the realization which online/cloud wallets are of the less safe options, I used my 12 seed phrase words to import my wallet into a coinomi wallet. everything was okay when Coinomi suddenly stopped working in our country due to some government restrictions (even doesn't work with vpn).

I, therefore with so much confidence used the same 12 words seed phrase to move on with other android cryptocurrncy wallets out there, however to my surprise, all of them showed 0 balance &amp; transactions on my bitcoin balance. since they didn't even show any transaction history, I didn't freak out about my money being stolen, It indicated that something was just wrong.

I was in such despair trying every wallet out there, weirdly some wallets showed a couple of my bitcoin transactions history and showing a portion of my balance. BUT When I Finally installed and tested Mycelium, after typing my seed phrase, all my transactions and my full bitcoin balance just appeared quickly and effortlessly. What is special with mycelium and what's the reason behind this and how can I access my bitcoins on other wallets as well?

TL;DR While Mycelium easily loads all my bitcoin balance and transaction history by importing my seed phrase, all other cryptocurrency wallets out there show $0, or in some cases, a few transactions and only a portion of my full bitcoin balance.

The current legal status of cryptocurrencies will be short-lived as the western governments begin to notice that hacking and extremist activities increase in activity despite our agencies well-coordinated efforts to stop them. The pain of a cryptocurrency crash and ban will be deemed less painful than the cost of continued assault by criminal groups because the main underlying, business of crypto-currencies is money-laundering and funding of criminal activities.

I've been doing quite a bit of research and I \*\*think\*\* I understand the basics of it, although admittedly my overall picture is fuzzy.

I do understand that platforms like SoFi and Robinhood are not ideal because you don't actually own your crypto, can't use it as a means of payment, are at risk of loss due to hacking, possibly subject to higher exchange fees, etc. So far, I've invested $450 into BTC through SoFi because I wanted to make a move of some kind while I was still figuring things out. I signed up for a Kraken account, but in the verification process I was told that because I live in NY they cannot verify my account because of laws around the ""BitLicense,"" and while they hope it changes in the future, cannot do anything currently. This for me, complicates an already complicated process and I don't want to kick the Crypto can down the road any further.

So, it‚Äôs far better to keep your earnings in crypto (preferably BTC or some stable coin if you must) than to sell it off to go buy that house, or car, or whatever.

Your average person thinks BTC is too expensive, and most of the time don't even realize you don't have to buy a whole BTC. I believe it would be beneficial for people to regularly use the sub-units as the price of a full BTC goes up. Of course there's no problem with saying BTC hit $250,000 to celebrate milestones, however I don't buy full bitcoin at a time (I wish).

It seemed to work, however the transactions disappeared before they were confirmed. Now the requests are gone, though the amounts are still present. Is this because I cannot move BTC within the same wallet? Or am I missing something?

Would be enough for a 51% attack, but miners would probably quickly abandon said mining pool and join another one. (if you are mining for a Chinese pool, might be worth considering switching to some smaller ones. SlushPool is the one I would choose, there was a thread saying how they kept payouts for the rightful owners for more than 7 years)  


**Big players trying to change the game**: SegWit2X [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/SegWit2x](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/SegWit2x) where BitPay managed to ruin its reputation. Still can happen in the future when there is no consensus.

- Executive Order 6102 is an executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States.""
- The stated reason for the order was that hard times had caused ""hoarding"" of gold, stalling economic growth and worsened the depression.
- The main rationale behind the order was actually to remove the constraint on the Federal Reserve preventing it from increasing the money supply during the depression. 
- The circumstances of the case were that a New York attorney named Frederick Barber Campbell had one deposit at Chase National Bank of over 5,000 troy ounces (160 kg) of gold. When Campbell attempted to withdraw the gold, Chase refused, and Campbell sued Chase. A federal prosecutor then indicted Campbell on the following day (September 27, 1933) for failing to surrender his gold.[12] Ultimately, the prosecution of Campbell failed, but the authority of the federal government to seize gold was upheld, and Campbell's gold was confiscated."

Bitcoin,"Is anonymity important to Bitcoin? Although many are excited about Bitcoin one issue is that exchanges like coinbase and 3rd party wallet providers now have a record of who you are and how you spend your bitcoin.

This really is an anti-thesis to the ideals of crypto for which anonymity is a major premise.

From talking nonchalantly to many newbies investing in crypto, it appears to me that many do not understand that coinbase (among others) can easily record who you are and where your bitcoins go for the rest of your life. Everything is on the blockchain and as AI improves, it will become easy to type in an address and get a google maps like navigational path of where you were and what you bought.

If the majority of people using Bitcoin are identified via KYC, and this is seen as not an issue, it may turn Bitcoin into something that can be regulated. It might be hard to sell/buy Bitcoin while staying anonymous. 

Do any of you see this as an issue to Bitcoin (and to other cryptos)?

Do you think it matters if Bitcoin no longer becomes anonymous?

If Bitcoin is no longer anonymous, could it be regulated and therefore hijacked as a fiat currency thus defeating the whole point of it?

EDIT: By anonymous I mean no one knows your address and it is not tied to your identity to any government, corporation or agency."

Bitcoin,"Block Reward Maximum 6.25 BTC or am I wrong?? Almost every block I see mined have a newly generated coins of more than 6.25 BTC.

[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/0000000000000000000266483b5a85cac76ad8c8957129b0d51b68c75d99d9ac](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/0000000000000000000266483b5a85cac76ad8c8957129b0d51b68c75d99d9ac)

I thought the halvening was supposed to limit it to 6.25 from 12.50 BTC. If 7 BTC is being claimed, doesn't it theoretically mean more than 21 million BTC can exist?

What I thought is that, if less blocks were mined per hour, reward should be be spread out as well, but that doesn't make sense since BTC follows halvening based on blocks and not time.

I'm not sure if i'm thinking of this correctly, any input would be appreciated.

Bitcoin,"Donating Some Bitcoin I've read several posts recently from individuals living in Venezuela, and elsewhere, describing financial struggles. It sounds like an average person or family will make very little each month, and some have adopted bitcoin as a way to preserve value. I'd like to donate some of my bitcoin, in small distributions around $10 USD, and would like some input and guidance from the community.

SOLVED: the most efficient way to do this is with Lightening Network payment requests. Receivers will need to create a wallet (consider these top wallets) [https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/lightning-network/wallets/](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/lightning-network/wallets/) and then send me the request for $10 USD 0.000183 BTC which will look like a long string of letters and numbers. Some people have been sending requests for $0, and with the LN I am unable to change the amount, so please make sure the request is for 0.000183 BTC. I can then send money using my nodes as I see fit! I've already tested this successfully with one individual and am ready to help others. Feel free to message me directly, but comments here are welcome because they might help people outside of your countries to make a friend and to learn what it's like to live in different parts of the world and how you're using bitcoin. A second problem I've encountered with this project is that the LN cannot find a path to many of these locations, so please also include a standard bitcoin address as a backup, even though the fees can be a significant percentage of the actual send, you will still get $10 USD, it will just cost me $5 in fees. **This is a great reason why more people should setup bitcoin and lightening nodes :)**

In conclusion, if you are from Venezuela or some other nation where $10 USD could significantly help you, family, or friends and you will provide a soft promise to use this donation for good, please chime in with a lightening address and I will consider donating to you."

Bitcoin,"Any Economics folks interested in a conversation about growing popularity of Bitcoin investment vehicles and its long-term impact on Bitcoin's value? I posted something similar yesterday, but received a lot of responses from people regurgitating the phrase ""supply and demand"" to me as if I've never heard of that before. But I think what we're seeing in the market right now is a little bit more complicated than that. Here's why:

There is growing popularity in investment vehicles tied to Bitcoin such as the Grayscale trust (GBTC) and the new Canadian ETFs (Evolve, Purpose Investments and I think they just launched one more), just to name a few. From what I understand, those funds are backed by actual BTC held in cold storage by the fund managers and their prices more or less track the price at which Bitcoin is trading in the crypto markets.

Now, relative to the total market cap of Bitcoin, these funds are still small potatoes. But what happens as more and more Bitcoin starts to get tied up in instruments like these instead of being available for active trading (either for investment purposes or for goods/services)? **Here is where the Econ 101 students have said ""supply and demand"" and moved on.** But I'm not so sure. Doesn't that inherently reduce its appeal as a currency? People want to buy into these funds because the vast majority of Bitcoin is not tied up in them and rather is available in the market and is being traded actively. As more and more is locked away, you could argue that the value of the available supply increases due to scarcity, but the reality is that at a certain percentage, let's call it the inflection point, the circulating supply can no longer dictate the value of the asset. Sure, in this scenario Bitcoin is extremely scarce and whatever is available SHOULD cost more, but that market value which is being applied to the circulating supply cannot also be applied to the abundance of it that is locked away. If a whale dumps, the price drops. The whale cannot sell their entire bag at the estimated market price just before they initiated the sale.

I guess as an example, imagine the extreme case where these companies own all 21M BTC (never going to happen, I know, not even close, but humor me). In that case, wouldn't it essentially cease having any value at all? None would be available for active trading or for exchanging for goods/services as all of it would be locked up in cold storage. And essentially, where would the demand come from for the trusts and ETFs themselves? If there was no longer a significant percentage of the asset being traded in the free market and having its value determined by supply and demand, what price do we attribute to shares of the trusts/ETFs? Does it have any value or real-world use if it sits entirely in Grayscale's cold storage? The foundation of this practice (of investing fiat to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without actually buying the Bitcoin) is that an active market price can continue to be applied to the supply not in circulation. That concept must have a breaking point. Where we'll land is somewhere not nearly as extreme as this example, but I do expect the amount held by those companies and new entrants to keep growing and growing."

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin? So what? Been doing a ton of research on blockchain technology. 

Seems cool. Seems nerdy. Seems highly technical. Seems like there may be some use case for it in some circumstance. I recognize it's been around for a bit and I'm late to the game but it's partially because every time I previously studied it, I was always left with the ""so what"" thought after. 

Utimately it's all based on this decentralization concept. Let's remove the central authority. Whether it's the government in the case of money, or a bank in payments, or Facebook in the case of personal information, the concept goes on and on. Let's distribute the data, secure it, and then have all network computers verify each entry. 

So to me, a simple logical question comes to mind. Without having any technical training, doesn't this just seem like a monumental waste of resources? Let's ignore the fact that it's cool, I admit it is, but now you will have 1 million computers verify something that 1 computer did before. Can you imagine a world where everything is done that way? My head hurts trying to even reconcile the waste of energy this will create. 

Then you kind of ask well why do we need this? I'm not convinced we do. Again, interesting concept, some nerdy tech guys put it together in a paper and programmed it, but sometimes those ideas are better left in textbooks because the real world isn't a science project. 

I'm rambling a bit. But if anyone here can talk beyond just Bitcoin and the price of it, which in my mind is like irrelevant really, let's discuss the underlying tech and why it's needed. To avoid corruption? Who cares. Is anyone really all that bothered in the developed world by that? I go to my bank and get my money. Do I care if it's central? They are regulated. Again someone can come up with some crazy scenario where central authorities fail, but in the fast majority of cases it's completely fine. 

Perhaps the biggest downside for crypto and blockchain will not be the idea itself, which I think it's brilliant, but the fact that it's not really needed.

Bitcoin,"How to become a Crypto Financial Advisor Hi guys, 

Been investing in Cryptos for some time and making some nice profits (thanks bull market!).  Naturally want to share the love and help others as much as I can and also help this new asset class really flourish as I think its a force for good in the world.  I have helped several friends invest in various coins.  I am full time Crypto evangelist, I gave up my job to do this.  So anyway my question . . . I live in the UK:

\- How can I legally give advice to friends and then later members of the public

\- Can I 'manage' other peoples finances for them.

So with one friend the technology scared her, she just wanted to me to handle everything.  She sent me her investment, I invested that (on well known Exchanges) and then sent the money to her hardware Wallet (which I taught her how to setup).  I send her a report of exactly what she bought, what the fees were etc.  I charged her nothing.  

Now though, people are coming to me asking me can I help!  I want to help BUT, I don't want to get into hot water when it comes to filing my taxes and the FCA regs in the UK.  If you can imagine, in the example above, it will show money coming into my bank, then into Crypto (Exchange) and out into cold storage then later that route but in reverse I expect when they want to cash out).  Messy to say the least.  Not to mention no insurance, no accreditations. 

Many people really want to get into Crypto, I have 20 years experience in the tech sector so for me its cake.  But for so many people trying not to get scammed, hacked and appreciating how to protect your private keys etc is just either more than they could cope with or just they don't have time to learn.  So they come to me.

Anyone have any suggestions of how I could work for myself, not contravene the FCA regs, and provide clients with security and peace of mind.

You cant get insured (indemnity / liability etc) if you are not accredited.  You cant get accredited in Crypto (so far as I know) as its so new!   I have asked the FCA if there is an route to become accredited, but I expect they will say I have to complete YEARS of training in the traditional finance sector first, then work for some bank and then finally work for myself.  No thanks!  Waiting to hear back from them.

Seems like companies that offer Crpyto investmest advise just charge an hourly rate.  But then that doesn't work if someone wants to just give you their investment for me to invest for them because how can they can assured you would not just walk away with their funds?!  I would not do this, I am honest, but this is not the point of course. 

Cheers guys, any thoughts appreciated."
Bitcoin,"Norwegian Oil Billionaire Joins the Bets on Bitcoin  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-08/billionaire-rokke-bets-bitcoin-will-be-on-right-side-of-history?sref=ab1w3h2J](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-08/billionaire-rokke-bets-bitcoin-will-be-on-right-side-of-history?sref=ab1w3h2J)

Oil billionaire Kjell Inge Rokke has come out strongly in favor of Bitcoin, as he bets the cryptocurrency will prove the best defense against the disruption facing the finance industry and central banking.

Rokke‚Äôs [Aker ASA](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AKER:NO), which controls oil and oil service companies and has more recently branched out into green tech and renewable energy companies, is setting up a new business, Seetee AS, to tap into the potential of Bitcoin, according to a statement on Monday.

‚ÄúBit¬≠coin may still go to zero. But it can also be¬≠come the core of a new monetary ¬≠architecture,‚Äù Rokke wrote in a [shareholder letter](https://www.seetee.io/static/shareholder_letter-6ae7e85717c28831bf1c0eca1d632722.pdf) on Seetee‚Äôs website. He says it‚Äôs not inconceivable that one Bit¬≠coin could  one day ‚Äúbe worth mil¬≠lions of dollars.‚Äù 

 ‚ÄúPeo¬≠ple who know the most about Bit¬≠coin be¬≠lieve its fu¬≠ture suc¬≠cess is near¬≠ly in¬≠evitable,‚Äù Rokke said.

For now, Rokke‚Äôs investment will be small, and Seetee will start with just 500 million kroner ($58 million) in capital. The firm plans to keep all its liquid investable assets in the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin has continued to divide opinions after a volatile start to the year. A single coin cost more than $57,000 at one point last month, compared with just over $8,000 roughly a year ago. The cryptocurrency has won some notable endorsements of late, including Elon Musk. It‚Äôs also been associated with some nail-biting investing moments, with Cathie Wood‚Äôs Ark Investment Management a notable example.

Goldman Crypto Chief Flags Institutional Demand Driving Boom

Aker‚Äôs Seetee will focus on investing in Bitcoin, establish partnerships with leading players in the Bitcoin and broader blockchain community, launch Bitcoin verification operations and invest in innovation projects and companies.

The Norwegian industrial company, with roots reaching back 160 years, has been active in investing in industrial software, fintech and green energy value chains. Its latest venture into cryptocurrency is intended to help pursue developments in cyber security, financial transactions and emissions-free verification operations, it said.

‚ÄúThe di¬≠rec¬≠tion is clear: fi¬≠nance will be dis¬≠rupt¬≠ed as sure¬≠ly as fos¬≠sil fu¬≠els will be,‚Äù Rokke said. ‚ÄúThe question is not if, but when.‚Äù"

Bitcoin,"Suntrust Bank closed someone's account with no warning. Left them with no ability to pay bills, feed their family, or pay for gas. Bitcoin fixes this. Currently the 2nd highest post on r / personalfinance (can't link to it because it'll get removed):

&gt; On March 3rd, 2021, my husband was out and tried to buy a cheeseburger, when his card declined. He called me to let me know his card was not working and asked if i could get to the bottom of it. I had noticed the previous day, that the app on my phone for our bank, SUNTRUST, was not letting me login as i was trying to check our funds for budgeting, and i assumed the app was being updated so i didn't bother with it. all in all, i ended up calling the customer service phone number on the back of my debit card, which connected me with a representative to whom i explained the current situtation. The representative began to stutter and could barely get a sentence out without placing an ""umm"" between every word, which instantly gave me anxiety. As she procceeded to answer my question as to why my card was not working, she stated ""The account has been closed, Suntrust decided they will no longer continue banking with you as per a 'routine review' of their accounts"". As you could imagine, i was instantly irate, Due to the fact that all of my husband and I's funds were in this one sole account, and i had not recieved ANY notification of closure or review. I instantly hung up the phone, and decided i would go down to my local branch, because surely this was some mistake.

&gt; As i arrived at the branch, i sat down with a banker in a very humid glass office, and kindly explained what the representative had told me on the phone, but that i had no knowledge of why this would have happened. The banker seemed confused as if this had never occured before, and procceeded to pull up my account. As he read over the notes, he remained quiet which i found odd. He turned to me and very plainly stated ""there are no notes in regards to the situtation, im not sure why, there is just a phone number provided for you to contact for more information, im sorry."" and handed me a paper with the said phone number on it.

&gt; I walked out of the building, and called the number in my car from the parking lot. It brought up the automated system for the suntrust fraud department, which then led to me to a representative with an international accent, most likely indian, which led me to assume this was an offshore phone number. I again had to explain my situation and yet AGAIN no explanation could be provided.

&gt; At this point, i was now past anger, and my emotions grew into fear, where is my money!?

&gt; I walked back into the branch, unsatisfied with the service being provided from this institution, and requested to speak with the manager. He politely led me into his office, as i again explained the situation. as the banker before had, the manager pulled my account up and read through what seemed like an endless amounts of notes, yet could not provide an explantion. He stated he had to call the 'back office' who are responsible for account closures, placed the call on speaker but as soon as someone picked up, placed it on a personal call so i could not hear the responses. The manager explained what was going on, and asked ""is there any information that i CAN provide to the client?"" which flew a huge red flag for me.. what do you mean what you can tell me? its my money for god sake, don't hide information.. but anyways, he continued on and could only state that the fraud department was reviewing my account and they decided to close the account. he could not provide any timeframe for when i would recieve my money, but that it would come through a check in the mail. I cried right there unapologetically, this bank took all our money, won't give us access to it online to even verify the amount in the account, and won't provide any further information.

&gt; I have no money to pay the bills, feed my family, put gas in the car. I don't know how this is even legal, as i have seen many other people's testimonies reporting the same, with no luck for a resolution. We had thousands of dollars in this account, and they took it all without remorse or explanation.

&gt; What do we do now? Get a lawyer? How do we pay?

&gt; If this has happened to you, i am so sorry, but this just can't be legal.

&gt; what now.

This story is frightening. Bitcoin helps me sleep well at night. Be your own bank."
Bitcoin,"Is it even worth investing in stocks anymore? Basically I just started earning enough in my life that I have spare money to invest it in. I woke up a bit too late with bitcoin (thought about buying in November, but giving birth to a baby took my mind off of it for a while) but still made quite a bit already but I'm thinking it would be probably smart to invest in something else too which is safer, like an etf. But you have to hold them also for a few years at least to have proper gains, and since I believe in bitcoin and will definitely hold at least until the next halving, I am not sure etf is less risky with a much lower gain. What do you guys think? I know I should do something with my money, sitting on a bank account means loosing value."

Bitcoin,"Why Bitcoin is a better idea than the US Dollar, explained. My last post on here got pretty popular, so I figured I would lay out why I think bitcoin is a better idea than the US dollar. I was originally going to lay out my entire bitcoin thesis here, but this post is getting way too long, so I'll likely be using this to supplement another post later on. That being said, this is still useful information (with my opinion sprinkled in) if you're new to Bitcoin or are only looking at it as a store of value. 

As you all know, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency. All this really means is that no single institution controls it. There have been decentralized currencies in the past, but none have checked most/all metrics (I'm cutting out the ones that both Bitcoin and fiat address) for a good currency. Wampum, or shell beads formerly used by some Native American tribes as currency, are not scarce and can be picked up off the beach- clearly not good for capitalism. Fungibility and portability put gold out of the running for a good currency, since gold comes in different standards of purity and is difficult to transport.

Fiat currency addresses these issues, but falls short in two metrics in particular. The first is security, since US dollars can be stolen. If you're smart and have a private Bitcoin wallet, this is pretty much a nonissue for Bitcoin now, and will become even more secure as institutions get serious about it. 

More importantly, fiat currencies have a huge issue with corruptibility. Those in power are always going to be able to manipulate the money to their advantage in this system, as we have seen with the stimulus packages in the past year. All you need to do is check graphs of the stock market vs the consumer price index to see that this is true. There is massive inflation in the stock market right now, while the CPI has remained relatively stable; simplifying this as much as possible, this just means that most of the stimulus money isn't making it to everyday people, else the added money supply would reduce demand and prices of everyday goods would go up. Since it's in the stock market, however, the only issue that has really been exacerbated is wealth inequality (80% of the stock market is owned by the top 10% of earners, so this is a no brainer). 

Having a corruptible currency isn't necessarily a bad thing, so long as you're rich. With the rich being assholes who can't help themselves, it's no surprise that we've printed 4 trillion dollars and the average American struggles to put food on the table. It only becomes a problem once inflation kicks in and people stop having faith in their devalued currency. I think you see where I'm going with this. 

Bitcoin addresses all of these issues. Bitcoin has a maximum supply is 21 million coins (cannot be corrupted and is scarce), is verified by blockchain (fungibility), is extremely portable due to phones, and has better security than the US dollar. While liquidity is a bit of an issue right now, as many places won't accept bitcoin, this is changing very quickly and is the last large hurdle for Bitcoin to clear (besides maybe recognizability). 

Once again, however, the key issue here is corruptibility, which is why larger institutions are so scared of Bitcoin. It's a lot harder to manipulate wealth without having control of the currency your wealth is kept in. Because of this, rich people who are advantaged by a fiat currency will have two choices: to fight against Bitcoin and manipulate their wealth as much as possible while delaying adoption, or to join in and bet that Bitcoin will make them more money in the long run. Some might not even be aware that this is a decision they're effectively making by staying away from Bitcoin, since they're always trying to manipulate their wealth because they're greedy, but fact of the matter is they're still delaying Bitcoin adoption.

I'm getting a bit off track, so I'll cut this post short here. Hopefully, this helps to explain from an why Bitcoin is a better idea than the US Dollar. I'll definitely be posting on why I think Bitcoin actually will start replacing the US dollar as well, so keep a lookout for that if you like this post."

Bitcoin,"Not everyone is going to own one bitcoin I know this is obvious, both from a mathematical and trend point of view, but I just can‚Äôt get over this point. 

I‚Äôve been hearing this argument for years. 5 years ago, people said that eventually, people won‚Äôt even be able to own one bitcoin and I had a hard time relating to it. 

Recently, some friends and family wanted to buy bitcoin, and I asked them how much, and they said, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and some 0.01. People can‚Äôt afford more. Then it really dawned on me. People won‚Äôt be able to get even that amount soon.

If they can‚Äôt afford it now, how are they going to afford it in 2-3 years?

As soon as one or two rich people admit to buying it, we‚Äôre going to see the price sky rocket. As soon as people like jeff besos, warren buffet, and bill gates (I know he is opposed it now) start buying, the flood gates are going to open. And the middle class wont even be able to afford 0.1 bitcoin. Or even 0.01. 

This has been so hard for me to relate to because it has been easy and cheap for me."

Bitcoin,"Unclear Regulations Can Be As Harmful As No Regulations We all know that governments all around the world are obsessed with crypto regulations. There are a lot of discussions about taxation and legislation. We are all discussing how terrible the regulations might be. However, it turned out that unclear and not quick enough actions may be very damaging for the industry. South African crypto firms are threatening to leave the country if there are no clear regulations. Representatives of the local crypto firms claim that the South African financial system is not willing to provide necessary banking services, thus their customers are not able to purchase crypto with local currency.

Bitcoin,"The Giving Block I made a comment on a post a few days ago suggesting that instead of dumping the entirety of your stimulus check (that you may not need) into the crypto market, perhaps you should consider donating some.

Of course I was mocked and ridiculed but hey, it's the internet, people are dicks. 

Anyway, I decided to do some research and apparently there are a lot of non-profits that accept crypto donations. So that means that you can do both! Buy crypto AND support a good cause.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin correlated with Tech stocks YES or NO? Hey all,

**Will get straight to the point:**

The consensus is that bitcoin is uncorrelated to the overinflated stock market (especially tech stocks on the NASDAQ). Moreover, it is a store-of-value and hedge against inflation (digital gold argument).

However...over these past weeks since the price came down from the $58k ATH, I've noticed that when stocks are shaky and NASDAQ is down &gt; we see the same price action trend on crypto. Likewise today we're looking very green on crypto and at the same time the NASDAQ bounced back 3.3% after a slump.

Connected to this are the 10 year treasury bond yields:

* IF UP &gt; crypto+equities DOWN, 
* IF DOWN &gt; crypto+equities UP.
